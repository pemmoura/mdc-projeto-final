Show,Sentiment,Review
Mad Men,0,"With each new season, I try to remind myself that the show is a slow burn. The first episode wasn't as glacial as the first episode of last season, but it still dragged a bit."
Pieces of Her,0,"Well acted and highly suspenseful, the eight-part Netflix thriller “Pieces of Her” never lets up. This is a good thing for the first five episodes. Then it grows exhausting."
Brave New World,0,"Huxley's novel was revolutionary when it was published nearly 90 years ago, but the show has turned it into just another piece of consumer content."
Stranger Things,0,"What we're left with is a disjointed poorer show. One that's trying to go in various directions, but doesn't always have the room for it, despite the crazy runtimes. I'm afraid Stranger Things 4 has gotten too big for its own good."
Lost,0,The series squandered its final season in a misguided effort to transform its trademark narrative ingenuity into a grand metaphysical statement.
Brave New World,0,"Slick, expensive-looking and with the biggest name behind it, ""Brave"" should have been Peacock's best offering, but instead is its biggest flop."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"It's a deeply terrifying story of manipulation and abuse that plays like a comedy, sometimes when it doesn't mean to, but isn't all that funny when it's trying to be."
Star Trek,0,"Season one changed the genre as we know it, and the second season equally so; it's just a crying shame that the third couldn't have made it a hat trick."
Sex/Life,0,A show that has no idea what kind of message it wants to send.
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"A paint-by-numbers thriller that ostensibly investigates the nature of sexual consent without really making us feel invested in any of the characters involved, however well-acted."
Brave New World,0,"It's just never compelling, never engrossing and, worst of all, not thought-provoking to the degree it needs to be given its subject matter and acclaimed, if dated, source material."
The First Lady,0,"There's never quite enough from any one first lady, which leaves a sense of disappointment. It's unfortunately a show that is lesser than the sum of its Emmy- and Oscar-winning parts."
Pieces of Her,0,"Despite a gripping and finely acted opening act, this series fails to deliver on the type of artful suspense and nuance it hints at early on."
Loki,0,"Loki could well improve, now that its arduous task of educating us about multiverses, and glumly explaining Loki to himself, is with any luck behind it. Let's hope so."
Amazing Stories,0,"With only 52 minutes of running time, The Cellar feels like a TV movie condensed to the length of a TV episode. Its characters are painted in wide brush strokes."
House of Cards,0,What was once macabre is now mundane.
Shameless,0,"I understand that Shameless continues to find Frank useful, but the results are never actually interesting, nor do they ever add up to anything."
Homeland,0,"Overall the first four episodes made available for review plod along... But then, just as I'm about to write off this final season, something happens at the end of the fourth episode that pulls me right back in. Just like Carrie, I can't seem to let go."
Invasion,0,"Invasion doesn't appear to be all that interested in exploring, you know, the actual alien invasion bit of its plot - and that's a problem."
Big Little Lies,0,The final episode seems to emerge from a lack of ideas about how to get these five women together again in the same room. It just doesn't work. [Full Review in Spanish]
Sharp Objects,0,"It has everything to be a hit, but Sharp Objects does not captivate. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Treadstone,0,"As spy dramas go, this one is better left out in the cold."
Night Sky,0,"Night Sky begins as a beautiful coming-of-old-age story, but it splinters into an overstuffed sci-fi thriller."
Chloe,0,"It’s not that Chloe is awful... It’s just a bit implausible, and far too slick for its own good."
Night Sky,0,"After that first hour, you may be holding back tears. But after seven more, your eyes have glazed over, and even these luminous stars can’t bring you back to Earth."
WandaVision,0,"Once WandaVision starts recycling the same content in each episode, it becomes difficult to ignore that the show's primary interest is playing with form rather than propelling its story forward."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"Bad wigs, limp characterization, indifferent plotting."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"[Mayor of] Kingstown, written by Sheridan, is another muscular soap that's long on characters talking in indecipherable lingo and short on clarity."
Mr. Corman,0,"Mr. Corman is billed as a ""comedy,"" somehow, but it's missing the laughs. It seems to be going for cringe comedy, but we just end up cringing. I felt more sad watching it than anything."
What If...?,0,"""What If...?"" is more of a ""WTF?"" Under all the bells and whistles, the Disney streamer is blatantly aiming to stave off losing Marvel subscribers with Saturday morning standard graphics and pretty rudimentary storytelling."
The Crown,0,You know there are problems with Gillian Anderson's performance from the moment the camera settles on her ashen Back to the Future hair.
The Mysterious Benedict Society,0,"There is potential in here, though, especially through the committed performances from the cast. But right now The Mysterious Benedict Society needs more mysteries and fewer answers."
The Ipcress File,0,"The world has turned, and turned again. These old games feel a bit silly, a bit staid: misplaced nostalgia masquerading as thrilling sensation."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"No expense was spared in building sets and procuring costumes that make the socioeconomic details of this story come through crisply, but both characters are, in the end, ciphers."
Limitless,0,A good sci-fi flick forced into a generic procedural TV show.
The Wheel of Time,0,"I never felt like I was watching an unfolding story, but I absolutely felt like I was watching the whiteboard in a writers room, more the pushing of note cards toward a destination than an adventure."
Mare of Easttown,0,"It's nice that HBO has turned out another handsomely produced, manifestly serious mini-series for the wonderful actress Kate Winslet. It would be nicer if those series were worth her time and talent."
True Detective,0,Mahershala Ali is the most notable thing about this third season that desperately tries to imitate the first season. [Full Review in Spanish]
A Teacher,0,It takes its sweet time getting anywhere and it's not an engaging trip. Both Ms. Mara and Mr. Robinson create characters who are sympathetic but also uninteresting; neither provides a reason to hang on.
Catastrophe,0,"It's often snobby and more than occasionally mean. It has a thin, subtle story, and lacks memorable set pieces."
Good Sam,0,I'm as game as the next fan for a new House. This just isn't there yet.
The Undoing,0,"Indeed, the show seems to relish the disorder that the Frasers cause in other people's lives, the pain they mete out. Throughout it all, the family remains static: glamorous, somehow still in control."
Succession,0,"I come not to bury ""Succession"" nor to praise it, but to perpetually hope it will take up that messy space between paranoia and performative nonchalance."
Halo,0,"The video game Halo excelled at letting players become the hero  with the new Halo TV series, audiences are instead saddled with a series devoid of a soul."
The Stand,0,"I can see that this concept might have seemed mind-blowing at the time, or mind-blowing at the right time in someone's cultural coming of age, but today, it is pretty old cheese, having been worked over endlessly in the interim."
The First Lady,0,"The writing is often clunky, obvious and filled with Big Picture Messaging, and too many of the supporting characters are one-note caricatures."
11.22.63,0,Feels like something ABC might have aired in 1997.
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"The Time Traveler’s Wife is so unsatisfying, it’s a bit baffling why anybody, let alone Steven Moffat, whose work as a writer and showrunner includes Doctor Who and Sherlock, decided to have a go at it."
Lisey's Story,0,"Learn what is a Blood Bool in this florid, Grand Guignol Gothic fairy tale, that misses an essential element of heavy material - relief."
The Fall,0,"Its hallmark traits of knife-edge tension, sexual discussion and psychologically-charged scenes have been posted missing, and replaced with an hour of medical procedures and jargon that would bore the most ardent of E.R. fans."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,...the series is driven by a muddle-headed and confused notion about what's wrong with the U.S...
Loki,0,"Can't have a Multiverse of Madness without introducing the multiverse first, right?"
Veep,0,The cast of Veep is so abject that it is one-dimensional. [Full review in Spanish]
The Problem With Jon Stewart,0,"Part of that may be because of the vitality of its guests, Jenifer Lewis and Bassem Youssef. Maybe ""the problem"" with the series is Stewart himself."
Prison Break,0,"The reality is that Prison Break in 2017 is basically a collection of ideas that Homeland passed on, if you can imagine that."
Safe,0,"It can whirr on, in its mechanical way, without me."
Outer Range,0,"Outer Range has expansive scenery (when it can be seen), and decent performances from Brolin, Taylor, and Poots. But neither its family drama and supernatural elements are compelling enough to make up for the show’s slow pace."
Lovecraft Country,0,Lovecraft Country links to literary racism simply for fake topicality. Anti-American nihilism and hopeless racial cynicism give the show its gotcha.
The Offer,0,"Strange pacing and unnecessary subplots bog down The Offer's more enjoyable moments, turning what could have been a thrilling look at movie history into an uneven television show."
Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,0,"Ashley Zukerman's Robert Langdon is an acceptable ""everyman"" hero with twinges of academic arrogance and situational awkwardness, but the overall mystery feels derivative and dopey."
The Book of Boba Fett,0,"Disney left its content farm out in Tatooines suns for far too long, a wilted mess of a commodity masquerading as a television show. What a sad showing, not just for Star Wars, but for art itself."
The Morning Show,0,It's baffling how a series with such a talented and star-studded cast managed to bypass prestige drama and land in the realm of soap opera.
Ozark,0,"The tension all goes slack, formerly compelling characters end up being waved at each other like wooden dolls, and yet another prestige drama leaves the audience wondering why they bothered."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"Unless the story improves significantly, it's hard to imagine a scenario in which Mayor of Kingstown gets reelected."
Mad Men,0,Each season is starting to resemble an animated cartoon where the same landscape rolls by over and over again. We've seen a lot of these story lines before.
The Righteous Gemstones,0,"While fans of the show's first season will likely enjoy the second, its humor too often falls into the habit of reveling in the dumb, gross, and broadly obnoxious."
The Undoing,0,The Undoing becomes overly long and formulaic. It's less interesting than Big Little Lies and has less on its mind socio-politically than Little Fires Everywhere.
The Flight Attendant,0,"While everything was new to Cassie the first time around -- making her a sort of classic Hitchcockian Everywoman, way over her head in this world of espionage -- the mystery here proves more convoluted and difficult to track."
The OA,0,"Events, characters and half-formed ideas are thrown at the screen then abandoned in favour of fresh mysteries, the show infinitely rolling out a carpet of kookiness."
Gentleman Jack,0,"The trouble with this period drama, based on the 1830s diaries of the stridently lesbian Miss Lister, is that it’s hard to care about her fiscal affairs."
Lisey's Story,0,"While Lisey's Story was one of King's best novels in part because of its complexity, he was unable to edit down the endless subplots and subtext that float well in the novel's undercurrents but become choking and unwieldy on screen."
Arrested Development,0,I wanted to laugh like never before. Voice of the narrator Ron Howard: I did not succeed. [Full Review in Spanish]
The Bletchley Circle,0,"Instead of stroking suspense, the show starts and stops in fits, never finding a thrilling stride that unites the mysteries and deepens characterizations. Let's hope that Anna isn't on a permanent vacation."
The Wheel of Time,0,"The visuals have some magic here, but the overall journey fails to cast any sort of spell."
WandaVision,0,"The end product is comedically wan, the double-takes broad and all the Olsen/Bettany/Hahn charm squeezed into tiny dabs of screen time"
Ginny & Georgia,0,"Ginny & Georgia wants us to love the way that Georgia always manages to stay one step ahead... Instead, I kept hoping that Child Protective Services would finally catch up."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"Maybe such candor is too much to ask of a show created for a platform owned by one of the world's most valuable corporations. Sadly, the alternative leaves us with a commercial for thinking about America more than a complete thought."
And Just Like That...,0,"And Just Like That... is a massive departure from Sex and the City in all the worst ways. It trades in its wit for a humorless, tone-deaf sequel series that struggles to make any case for its existence."
Halo,0,"The derivative touches can't help but make the whole exercise feel generic, exhibiting a lot of hardware but not much creative spark."
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,"Bloated, disheveled story but a super soundtrack and performance by Reg E. Cathey."
Joe vs Carole,0,"Coming out a full two years after the cultural rubbernecking that made Netflix’s Tiger King a brief sensation, the show’s refusal or inability to streamline the themes and narrative of this story has gone from innocuous to grievous."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"While the strong ensemble cast made for a promising set-up, the series was besmirched by an increasingly infuriating script and a trite ending that had this viewer hurling decaying vegetables at the screen."
The Right Stuff,0,"The Right Stuff is not bad, or even boring, just thin and unconvincing."
Little Voice,0,"Yes, those who love musical performances, New York, and the work of Sara Bareilles will likely find a lot to enjoy here, but overall Little Voice is mostly as a disappointment."
Moon Knight,0,The first three quarters of this six-episode season is a vague story that takes a long time to go nowhere. There's not enough character for a character study and not a clear enough plot for a satisfying thriller.
Stranger Things,0,"The whole experience felt like being forced to eat every menu item from the Cheesecake Factory over the course of a day: lots of deliciousness, some things you never wanted, and the whole experience leaving you feeling nothing but bloated."
The Twilight Zone,0,All over the map... Rod Serling had overworked himself into a state of total burnout from which he would never fully recover.
Bel-Air,0,"Painfully earnest and mostly stripped of its original buoyancy, this formerly amusing and entertaining fish-out-of-water story is left gasping for an original thought."
Arrested Development,0,"What's missing here, to a depressing degree, is a sense of purpose."
Chernobyl,0,"We should be engaged by the tragic flaws and nobility of all this by this point, but the story and characters have gone so uncorralled that it takes all your viewing energy just to keep it fractionally straight."
The Undoing,0,It was a bumpy flight that wound up in a dingy parking lot.
His Dark Materials,0,With so much time taken up with gabbing there was little left for the kind of spectacle that made the first series a hit.
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"What's frustrating about Little Fires Everywhere is that the discrepancy between the novel and the miniseries implies that A-list actors are all the show has to offer, when what should really shine is Ng's wise, haunting story."
Rise,0,"Mr. Mazzu is like Rise itself: sweet, earnest, cloying, and also obnoxious."
Big Little Lies,0,"The series works best when it focuses on intimate, human moments rather than on broad social critiques."
Limitless,0,"Limitless comes off as rote, slick and bloodless.The show is based on the film of the same name and expect occasional Bradley Cooper drop-ins, but unless Limitless lives up to its name and starts achieving far more of its potential, I'll pass."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,Romance fluff with a hokey twist isn’t my cup of tea.
Foundation,0,"""Foundation"" has the space for Asimov's seemingly endless plot points to breathe. Even so, it's much to take in, though creators David S. Goyer and Josh Friedman deserve kudos for making the effort at achieving the impossible."
Lisey's Story,0,"Director Pablo Larraín and a splendid cast led by Julianne Moore and Clive Owen are left with the task of making Lisey's Story cinematic, resulting in a push-and-pull that's all-too-visible, especially in the series' clumsy back-half."
The X-Files,0,"Once we were charmed by this gloriously imaginative fiction, but with this latest iteration Chris Carter has only managed to weave a tapestry of unparalleled nonsense."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"[Krysten] Ritter, who took such fantastic ownership of this character, deserves more than a season that finds Jessica more or less where it always does-let down by those around her."
Foundation,0,"The time jumps are confusing and the story needs a clearer arc. It doesn't feel immersive enough and, absent the texture of everyday life, the stakes feel too theoretical. The editing is clunky and the show lacks a sense of humor."
Suspicion,0,"This viewer simply lost the patience waiting for the show to allow Thurman, a gifted performer who too rarely gets the chance to let loose these days, to do much of anything."
Ozark,0,I was annoyed and rolling my eyes. I was on the edge of my seat wondering if the show would do anything truly surprising.
Foundation,0,"For people who know or are fans of Isaac Asimov and his work, I feel compelled to warn you that if you watch the show you will see a scene so enraging that you will tear your TV in two with your bare hands."
The X-Files,0,"The adjustments made for the opening episode show less of the kind of creative skills that made episodes like ""Triangle,"" ""Home"" and ""Ice"" so memorable and come across as a uninspired solution to what looked like an unfixable situation."
Star Trek: Prodigy,0,"The show mostly just transparently trades off the ""Trek"" title without feeling like it's going anywhere, boldly or otherwise."
Stranger Things,0,It feels both overstuffed and slackly paced at the same time.
Bridgerton,0,"Theres something to be said for familiarity, but Bridgerton keeps most of the less interesting stuff from last season and jettisons the scandalous intrigue we tuned in for in the first place."
Narcos,0,"For all the shake-ups in the cast and in the show's scope, Narcos is still Narcos."
You,0,"For a thriller that was previously known for dealing largely in shock value, Joe's actions - accompanied once again by his over-indulgent inner monologue - now start to wear thin to the point of becoming predictable."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Yet drastically improved action sequences...just aren't enough to salvage Iron Fist, let alone keep general audiences interested."
All American,0,"I expected more from this show - do better, All American."
Weeds,0,Almost completely misses.
WandaVision,0,"Disney Plus's new Marvel show WandaVision promises a surreal spin on a 1960s sitcom reality. But so far, it's delivered little more than winks and nods to Marvel Cinematic Universe loyalists."
Killing Eve,0,"Like a bad romance, Killing Eve is keeping its couple apart without logical or emotional justification. In the process, it’s dulled the spark provided by these two excellent actors as well as the tension sustained by their taste for danger."
All of Us Are Dead,0,"While the diminishing returns of the shows narrative are a disappointment, the moral implications of its wide-ranging smorgasbord of social commentary are bewildering, if not outright alarming."
After Life,0,"Monologues about grief and recovery are painfully trite, painfully single-dimensional; it falls short of even syrupy fare like Ted Lasso."
Sex/Life,0,"Having watched all eight episodes of the show, what I remember from it isn't how steamy the sex scenes are (not least because they aren't), but how frustrating I found Billie and all of the people around her."
The Stand,0,"[The novel] captured a crisis through small stories that converged to form a larger reality. Had the show retained the novel's pacing, and opted for grief over gore, King's message of humanity's resilience might have carried more weight in these times."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"The series, as it cycles through satire, horror, and prestige psychodrama, can't quite decide whether the wellness industry is a virulent scam or a desperately needed curative for broken souls."
Outer Range,0,"Outer Range isn’t consistently satisfying as a drama series, though as an extended metaphor for television viewing circa 2022, this story of a Wyoming family throwing things in a mysterious hole on their ranch is at least unintentionally savvy."
Sex/Life,0,"Rather than interrogate why Billie's sublimated her needs for the sake of a relationship, the series seems concerned only with titillating viewers -- and, despite Shahi and Demos' athleticism and enthusiasm, even that gets old."
The First,0,"Well shot, at times edited like an inspiring Super Bowl ad, the show falls into a curious trap of pretension. It seeks to be a ""serious"" show using astronauts, instead of being a good show about the potential of space travel."
And Just Like That...,0,"The result of this sequel or reboot, while not being embarrassing, is quite disappointing. [Full review in Spanish]"
Moon Knight,0,"As much as I enjoyed watching Marc and Steven argue with each other in some Gollumesque fashion, I kept getting lost when the storyline switched from one character to the other."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Out of all the thriller fare that Kelley has adapted for the small screen to date, the whole of Anatomy of a Scandal is disappointingly much less compelling than the sum of its parts."
True Detective,0,"True Detective Season 3 is a little more workmanlike and less baroque, perhaps too eager to prove that it can tell a legible story again."
The Offer,0,"The Offer certainly didnt have Coppolas blessing, and I hope this wasnt the reason behind his problematic portrayalhe is shown not as an angsty New Hollywood artist, but as a comedic buffoon."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"Unless Alice and her rabbit pal have more tricks up their sleeve than Snow White and the gang could muster, ABC's visit to Wonderland might once again leave the network less in need of a looking glass than a rear-view mirror."
Outer Banks,0,"If you don't want to broach the issue of race here, then don't tie the treasure to slavery. But if you're going to make that link, you have a responsibility to actually talk about it and the implications."
Rise,0,"Rise wants to be an inspiring drama. More accurate to describe it as a drama about wanting to be inspirational...Rise seems uninterested in its own best instincts, willing to bring up ideas but unwilling to carry them over the finish line."
24,0,Live Another Day feels terribly dated.
Inventing Anna,0,"There is a brilliant drama to be had from the story of Anna Delvey, and when someone makes one I’ll be sure to let you know."
Mare of Easttown,0,"With the overwhelming variety of ""prestige"" content that exists in every nook and cranny of the internet and beyond right now, Mare of Easttown isn't exactly appointment television."
Bel-Air,0,Bel-Air strives for authenticity in the most thinly drawn manner possible.
Moon Knight,0,Oscar Isaac can't salvage middle tier MCU entry.
The Pentaverate,0,"While I am glad I didn’t have to pay to see this on the big screen, I enjoyed laughing at some dumb jokes for a couple of hours."
Sex/Life,0,"It loses its rhythm and goes round in circles trying to make a point but it fails terribly. The writing is shallow, the acting sub-par and at most, the racy scenes are endurable."
WandaVision,0,You'll have to wade through a middling '60s sitcom to see what's really going down on Marvel's unconventional WandaVision.
The Big Bang Theory,0,"I'm not sure if they got the physics exactly right, but The Big Bang Theory somehow ended not with a breakup but an ""I love you."""
The Stand,0,Never rises above a slightly dreary competence.
Altered Carbon,0,"It had good moments, it had bad moments, it had dull moments. I kind of wish now that there was just Season 1 standing alone as a great example of the genre..."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,There are several bizarre gaps in the shows structure.
Loki,0,"The series achieves its ultimate manifestation as Saturday-afternoon animation. With Loki, Marvel, Disney, and their die-hard constituents have found ways to make the banal even more banal."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,0,"While I was happy to see Estevez on screen, the character is flat and unpleasant, giving little explanation about his backstory until episode three."
Waco,0,"The show creates its own problems in telling this story, especially as it can't seem to handle the scope."
The Nevers,0,"There are too many characters, too many high-stakes plotlines, and not enough explanation for how it all connects."
Once Upon a Time,0,Once Upon a Time's magic is gone.
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,Has Iron Fist improved at all? The short answer: Kind of?
24,0,"The contemporary anxiety 24 hopes to exploit this time around is of drones and of the increasingly dehumanized nature of warfare, but it has become a sort of dehumanized show, populated by barely human characters."
Invasion,0,"While it's an ambitious, sometimes welcome subversion of the genre, the approach often works to the series' detriment."
The Essex Serpent,0,"At least the drama lights up whenever Hiddleston appears on screen. Because it’s otherwise desperately dreary, which is unforgivable when the source material is so rich."
Inside Amy Schumer,0,"Schumer is as brazen and politically conscious as ever, but this season feels less personal and less urgent than last season...and more formulaic-sometimes even bordering on lazy."
Star Trek: Voyager,0,"Everyone on Voyager deserved better, especially Kathryn Janeway."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,It is a bleak drama series that doesn't seem to bring anything new to the table
Chucky,0,There's only one vaguely interesting formula tweak here and it's Mancini's decision to make his protagonist queer and then to handle it with a refreshingly casual sensitivity.
Arrested Development,0,"The problem with evoking past highlights as a narrative device, however, is that it relies on an unsullied memory of what's being evoked."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"The cast of Nine Perfect Strangers is too good for the limited series to ever be unwatchable. But after seeing six of eight hour-long episodes, I'm pretty sure the biggest mystery has nothing to do with any of the damaged characters."
Waco,0,"Waco won't be the first drama to reduce a tragedy to its simplest components, but this doesn't offer much confidence that these are the right components or the only ones."
The Nevers,0,"It is, indeed, steampunk Buffy with corsets -- and for several reasons, that's no longer an enticing concept."
House of Cards,0,It's eight-hours of filler to set up an immensely unsatisfying conclusion.
The Staircase,0,"The problem is, in a good fictional crime story, the writers and directors feel a sense of responsibility to make you care. Here, there’s an underlying assumption that we’ll care, and that assumption leads to plodding, stultifying drama."
The Nevers,0,"The Nevers is an unimpressive monument to a storyteller whose work has meant a lot to many people, but who cannot now figure out how to rise to the moment."
Big Shot,0,"The lack of proper development for its teen girls is the most troubling aspect of ""Big Shot,"" all things considered, the element that feels the most performative."
The Nevers,0,"The Nevers may get better when Whedon is no longer involved. It also may not. As it stands, the show is airing proof that Whedon's former proficiency, which insulated him from experiencing the consequences of his disturbing actions, has vanished."
Lovecraft Country,0,Lovecraft Country wears its progressivism like a costume.
Altered Carbon,0,"Altered Carbon has an amazing sandbox to work with, but the story doesn't always know how to play in it... The good news is that Season 2 ends on a note that could make Season 3 its best yet."
The First,0,"In the end The First feels much like Mars itself: cold, bumpy, and too far away to touch."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,What’s left is a show filled with so much hatred and ickiness it’s hard to believe anyone will find something to enjoy lurking inside all this muck.
The Nevers,0,"Despite sexy intentions, the series is sometimes laughably prurient. Moreover, it's riddled with Whedon's signature dialogue that's entirely too self-aware with how smart it's trying to be."
Roar,0,"In the end, the biggest problems with “Roar” may be failures not of the filmmakers, but of the medium itself. Some short stories simply work better on the page"
Inventing Anna,0,The result falls flat. Inventing Anna is a stretched-out nine-episode romp that never quite catches the enigma of its protagonist -- or matches her appeal.
Lisey's Story,0,"Lisey's Story's failings aren't an indictment of King the screenwriter, they're a tribute to King the novelist."
The Pentaverate,0,Mike Myers' affectionate but uneven conspiracy theory comedy is let down by its lowbrow humour.
Entourage,0,"That the new season begins with Vince having left that murk behind reinforces a consistent criticism of Entourage, that it's a lark and nobody every changes."
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"You end up wondering whether they are true soulmates, or just trauma-bonded beyond redemption. Christ, you think, move on, but, alas, they won't."
The Office,0,I concluded that I was watching a show that wasn't just winding down. It was being taken off life support.
The First,0,"The series may well develop into an absorbing character-led take on humankind's dream of exploring the solar system, but Willimon seemed to be relying on the audience having a bite at the second episode before deciding."
Prison Break,0,"It's utter nonsense. Mind-numbingly stupid. Worse yet, it's a bore."
God's Favorite Idiot,0,"This series seems to aspire to be something in between a workplace comedy and a supernatural romp, and it has its moments, yet as much as we love the actors not every comic premise succeeds."
The Lincoln Lawyer,0,"Despite some admirable efforts by its committed cast, this version of The Lincoln Lawyer never makes a compelling case for its lengthy and laborious existence."
Suspicion,0,"By the time Suspicion reaches its heavy-handed conclusion, we hardly care who done it and why they did it."
Invasion,0,Invasion is a slog - and not a particularly enjoyable one at that.
Joe vs Carole,0,"Despite ""untold story"" claims, Joe vs. Carole is dedicated to the already extensively chronicled exploits of Joe Exotic and Carole Baskin."
"Doogie Kamealoha, M.D.",0,"Right now, Doogie Kameāloha, M.D. is a predictable show on many fronts, including its slavish devotion to the original program."
The Shrink Next Door,0,The execution of the story doesn't feel balanced as an eight-episode series. It's oddly surface level at the same time never diving into the nuance or the complexities of how this could have happened.
Lisey's Story,0,"There are some interesting, often supernatural connections between the characters; the hard part is wanting to stick around long enough to see where they might lead."
Limitless,0,It's just not fun enough to be memorable.
Safe,0,"Safe could have been so good. All the ingredients were there for a prime binge-worthy crime thriller - the writers, the cast, the concept - but it just hasn't been given the time, care and attention it needed."
The Morning Show,0,"After watching Season 2, I struggle to be certain what this show is about. The answer, at this point, really isn't ""a morning show."""
Black Mirror,0,"The fifth series of Black Mirror is comprised of episodes that feel less like the work of Brooker and more like thin, wanting knock-offs that were inspired by him."
Devs,0,"It has [Alex] Garland's signature chilly and cerebral tone, but the pacing is sluggish."
Shadow and Bone,0,"'Shadow and Bone' is trying to show way too much in too little time, leaving its best intentions emotionally stunted and inert."
Game of Thrones,0,"In the final six episodes, Game of Thrones should have felt like a game of chess. Instead, it veered very close to feeling more like a game of checkers. And that's probably why so many viewers felt burned."
The Wheel of Time,0,"As much as The Wheel of Time left me indifferent, I very much warmed to the universe of the Aes Sedais. Your introduction to them is Moiraine, and it's difficult not to be intrigued by her order. She's the type of woman who doesn't hear ""no"" often."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Its lead character doesn't deserve top billing, and maybe never will. So until Daughters Of The Dragon becomes a reality, we'll keep checking out Iron Fist for the rest of the fight card."
Twin Peaks,0,"The original run is one of TV's masterpieces, and Lynch finally returning to this project -- and unshackled by network restrictions -- was great news. In retrospect, limitations might have been welcome since this suffers from extreme excess and overkill."
The Nevers,0,"It feels empty, as if the scripts are just going through the motions; the characters have so little substance beyond their spunky quips that the dramatic moments, when they inevitably arrive, ooze into each episode like treacle."
Lisey's Story,0,"The problem is that when it's this close to the heart, it can often be a case of not being able to see the wood from the trees."
The Morning Show,0,"I liked that season one was a little campy. This season, however, summoned the ghosts of Joan Crawford, the cast of Grease 2, and Lady Gaga's Artpop era."
The First,0,"It's too much buildup for too little payoff. By the time the series is ready to launch, we're already charting a course for somewhere else."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,One crucial departure from the formula is the writing.
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,"Despite a plethora of well-tuned performances, its visuals and narratives stumble."
Pieces of Her,0,"While a new Collette performance is an event, the show often seems to be hiding its most effective onscreen asset, in favor of time spent in the past. And that past likely worked better on the page than onscreen."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,0,Fellowes hints at drama and pulls his punches.
Pieces of Her,0,"In order to stretch out the drama...it can drag a little bit rather than make it interesting to
watch... By the time you figure out what's going on, which is four or five episodes in, it loses steam."
The Boondocks,0,The Boondocks is wrapping up its run by being more like Al Pacino as Al Pacino in Jack and Jill: a sad-looking shell of itself that sometimes recaptures its past spark but has seen better days.
What If...?,0,"The idea of taking such popular, well-worn characters and scrambling them throughout this massive worldbuilding experiment sounds fun, but the results so far are pretty lukewarm."
Tokyo Vice,0,"An exercise in lost momentum, a glimpse at a fading underworld loath to offer any perspective on it. Maybe the wildcat was just a tabby the whole time."
Wolf Like Me,0,"Wolf Like Me might claim to be a TV show, but its really a movie. (A short one, at that.)"
Arrested Development,0,They've made a huge mistake.
Behind Her Eyes,0,"Although it retains the book's shocking twist (it was marketed with its own hashtag #WTFThatEnding), even that is not enough to give Behind Her Eyes an edge over its umpteen counterparts."
And Just Like That...,0,Nothing about the show feels organic; so much about it is painfully forced.
A Very English Scandal,0,"""A Very English Scandal"" plays too much with tragedy."
Servant,0,"Those who've been just as mystified, expecting a third season to answer the many questions it's raised, or at least a deeper dive following the supernatural events of the Season One cliffhanger, will be terribly disappointed."
Turner & Hooch,0,"One difference between the film and the series - and it's a pretty significant one - is that Josh Peck is no Tom Hanks. Another difference - again, pretty significant - is that it's not 1989 anymore."
The Twilight Zone,0,"One of the major issues of Peele's debut season was the runtime for episodes. This season is no exception, and of the three episodes screened, only one truly earns the extra half-hour - and even then, it could easily be chiseled down."
The Gilded Age,0,"The real American Gilded Age was a period of huge upheaval, but Julian Fellowes' The Gilded Age zooms in so closely that the arc of change looks like a plateau"
Rise,0,"Yes, a talented, experienced, ""difficult"" woman was passed over for a job because an amateurish white guy woke up one day and decided he wanted to switch career paths."
True Detective,0,"While I appreciate Mahershala Ali's solid performance and the technical excellence of this gorgeous production, there is no sense of urgency or connection. Everyone is sleep walking through the case."
11.22.63,0,That the limited series squeaks by as just entertaining enough is a disappointment considering the pedigree of everyone involved and the reputation of its source material. Time travel and Dealey Plaza deserve better.
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"The only thing shocking about Anatomy of a Scandal is that David E. Kelley, creator of series like Picket Fences, Ally McBeal and The Lawyer, hasn't had a hit since the first season of Big Little Lies. [Full review in Spanish]"
Defending Jacob,0,"Defending Jacob suffers greatly from its format, stretching 120 minutes of story max into eight hours of episodic television."
And Just Like That...,0,"Ah, well."
Riverdale,0,"special events are not canon, which means that it's all a meaningless stunt designed to incorporate The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina into Riverdale and give K.J. Apa fans a brief heart attack."
Stranger Things,0,"Stranger Things 4 is a sad, indulgent, at-times-predictable slog. Episodes routinely run more than an hour and many characters are mopey."
Halo,0,"Between the series’s somewhat nondescript visual style and its overwhelming exposition, Halo is bogged down by world-building and almost hampered by its source material."
The Twilight Zone,0,"There's also a lot of potential for season two to reach the same highs that episodes like last season's ""Replay"" delivered. For now, though, season two is off to a mixed start."
The Wilds,0,"By starting from scratch with a whole new group of characters, The Wilds bifurcates its focus and renders everything more shallow as a result."
Halo,0,"Schreiber is, indeed, the most interesting thing about Halo -- which isn’t necessarily saying all that much."
Brave New World,0,"The nine-part debut season feels like it's built on miscalculation atop miscalculation, but the gravest one is that the citizens of New London are effectively extraterrestrials."
The Pentaverate,0,Little more than a cheap excuse for Myers to put on some prosthetics and do silly voices
Halo,0,"This adaptation offers a lot of explanations and fun effects but little else. Halo has the potential to be good time, but at least in its first episodes, it’s not quite there yet."
Stranger Things,0,"In the end, it isn’t growing up that threatens the unstoppable rise of Netflix’s great homegrown hit. It’s a refusal to let go of what no longer serves it."
The First Lady,0,"The Showtime miniseries, starring Viola Davis, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Gillian Anderson, manages to make life as a White House wife seem both cosmic and forgettable."
Gaslit,0,"The particularities of the way Nixonian paranoia played itself out over the national landscape defy easy comparison, and yet the show makes frequent, flat gestures towards the modern day."
Defending Jacob,0,"The result is imitation-flavored television - a chronic occurrence, six months after the streaming service's launch. There's a larger mystery there, and someone needs to solve it."
Man vs. Bee,0,"Imagine Parasite, if Parasite was the worst thing you’d seen in your life."
Outer Range,0,Brolin buffaloed by baffling black hole.
House of Cards,0,"Despite the hype, Season 6 isn't Claire's show. It's still Frank's, which undercuts the season's many attempts at women-first stories and keeps momentum stagnant."
The Nevers,0,The Nevers begins with an intriguing premise and develops it in such a plodding way that interest progressively fades with each successive hour.
The Book of Boba Fett,0,This spaceship feels a bit like it's on autopilot.
Landscapers,0,"Every bit of this story is as weird as hell. The trouble is that, on screen, weirdness itself doesn't really give you very far to go."
Vigil,0,"The artificial, strained, implausible plot twists and turns come and go, giving the Sunday night BBC TV audience their fix of ersatz tension and brainwashing."
Wolverine and the X-Men,0,"Blame whatever you like- the blatant Wolverine pandering, the departure from tradition- but the interest just wasn't enough to continue the story."
The Morning Show,0,"I'm not certain the show has anything to say, overall, about the news industry, about sexual abuse, about complicity, about cancel culture, or about workplace politics; so it has become one big time-filling mash of histrionics."
Weeds,0,"What was once a contained and quirky -- though sometimes dark -- comedy about a mess of a woman, has become a global disaster."
The Afterparty,0,"While it will elicit a chuckle or two, The Afterparty relies too much on stereotypes and your existing attachment to the actors. Despite a clever premise, it's let down by weak writing and an over reliance on experimental storytelling devices."
House of Cards,0,"The final eight episodes, which are all available for streaming now on Netflix, comes to a messy conclusion with more loose ends than a Florida election ballot."
Pachinko,0,"While showrunner Soo Hugh cannot have had an easy task in finding the series within this sprawling, multigenerational novel, and while she conjures moments of immense power, and of connection, throughout, Pachinko does not, finally, cohere."
Normal People,0,"If ""Normal People"" seeks to impart a lesson to its audience, it is this: Always forgive people who never change."
The O.C.,0,"Its peculiar mix of comic adult misbehavior, teen love and sexuality and sarcastic humor -- all played to a trendy musical soundtrack -- returns for a fourth season that illustrates it has stayed at the party too long."
Invasion,0,"Unfortunately, Invasion also borrows The Walking Deads molasses-like pace, without any of the payoff or precise characterization. The first season builds to a climax, sure, but its a story that lacks depth throughout."
Arrested Development,0,"Arrested Development just needs to get over the stories it's already told, and move on to the ones it's telling this time around."
Inventing Anna,0,"As watchable as the show can be, one cant help but see the better version lurking beneath the surface. Ultimately, iInventing Annai misses the point of what made Delveys story a viral sensation."
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"It's a master class that deserves recognition, and both actors reach the depth required to sell the dialogue. I just wish the material was worthy of their talents."
Inventing Anna,0,"By the end, Inventing Anna may test your resolve as you decide how much time you choose to spend in the company of an unrepentant bossy narcissist, regardless of how well she’s played."
Limitless,0,"There's a story to be told about what it means to be human in a tech-wild, catastrophe-rocked, profoundly uncertain age. Maybe someday, TV will give us that story. Until then, we get generic label pop like Limitless."
The White Lotus,0,"By the end of the six-episode miniseries, the farce is still ongoing, but the joke is thinking that things could have turned out any other way. Fates were always sealed."
Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey,0,Treating this saga mostly as a shocking play-by-play with a reptilian boogeyman at the center feels a little cheap.
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"Even though he was a compelling scene-stealer in Daredevil, Frank Castle/The Punisher has never felt quite right in his own show. Season two will do little to change that impression."
The Wheel of Time,0,It all feels somewhat conventional. Is it the show's fault or because many fantasy film and television adaptations have already been made? [Full review in Spanish]
Behind Her Eyes,0,"Ultimately, Behind Her Eyes has a lot of style to offer, but not much substance."
True Detective,0,"The towering talent of Ali almost straightens out the third season of True Detective from its ultimately dull centrifugal swirl. Yet,[it's] is overwhelmed by... capricious leaps in time and thinly spread philosophical space"
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"The real star of this woeful, pointless television programme is its toxic gender and sexual politics."
Altered Carbon,0,"The story itself is somewhat downgraded from a provocative examination of the role mortality plays in defining our humanity to a soap opera with a whole lot of gratuitous punching, kicking, and bleeding."
Stranger Things,0,The timing is terrible. The show itself gets slightly better from there.
Black Mirror,0,"With its move to Netflix, Black Mirror transformed from observing and satirising digital culture to becoming an active tool in some of its worst contemporary excesses."
The Staircase,0,"I strongly considered sticking a fork in my eye at least eight times while the footage rolled... and rolled, and rolled, and rolled."
Y: The Last Man,0,"A world with almost no men has so much potential, but this one is squandered on its mostly lifeless characters."
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,"That's a close metaphor for season 2, in that a prominent adaptation of a beloved comic property invites more scrutiny, and it's a shame it doesn't deliver."
The Offer,0,"It deserves credit for elevating my overall esteem for The Godfather in one respect: At no point in all of my viewings of Coppola's epic was I ever moved to scream at random intervals, ""OH MY GOD, WHO CARES?"""
The Act,0,"It's dull and lacking in creativity, and it's disheartening that what could have been an interesting exploration of factitious disorder imposed on another - and why we're morbidly fascinated by it - became a tawdry, unoriginal series of cheap shots."
The Sopranos,0,"While it is one thing to flout the conventions of television, it's another to flip dramatic tradition, not to mention your audience, the bird."
Big Little Lies,0,"By leaning into exaggeration this season, though, Big Little Lies has made its more sober elements feel like afterthoughts to jokes about the ridiculousness of Californians and self-absorbed stay-at-home moms."
Bridgerton,0,...it’s difficult to imagine that Bridgerton will ever make quite the splash that the first season did without stars like Page who strike the perfect balance between steamy and silly...
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,0,The series starts strong but its main character only grows thinner as the story progresses.
The Shrink Next Door,0,"Though the performances are uniformly terrific -- Ferrell has to walk the highest tightrope, making Marty believable but not too pathetic -- The Shrink Next Door is Exhibit A in streaming series bloat. There's not enough story to justify eight episodes."
True Blood,0,If there's any show that should go out with a bang it should be this one. Right now its looking like its going to be all whimper.
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,0,A series that started out a heartbreaker ends in a shrug.
The Undoing,0,"Like the seemingly perfect lives of its characters, it doesn't hold up under scrutiny."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,0,The characterizations are beginning to get cartoonish.
Arrested Development,0,"Season five proved that Arrested Development could imitate its glory years, but the Bluths don't seem to have anything funny left to say."
Snowflake Mountain,0,A bunch of supposed adults complaining about having to take a dump in a latrine.
The Pentaverate,0,The Pentaverate struggles under the weight of its main talent.
Doctor Who,0,Legend of the Sea Devils was quite disappointing. I appreciated the fresh scenery and all-Asian guest cast but the Sea Devils fell flat mostly due to poor directing taking all the excitement away from their fight scenes.
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"Though the second season attempts to redefine who its title character is and where he fits within this corner of the superhero universe, the end result is both an odd fit and a moot point."
The Baby,0,"It’s all pretty perfunctory and over-reliant on one single, repetitive plot point that ends up not being scary, sinister, or engaging enough to compel you to see what comes next."
Rise,0,"The audience doesn't get the chance to discover the students' strengths along with the characters...The way Rise unfolds now, there's no tension and no release. Events just happen one after the other."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,0,"Just securing a project featuring Jackson (who produces as well as stars) is probably coup enough for the streaming service, but the marquee value doesn't overcome what turns out to be a slog as a viewing proposition."
The Gilded Age,0,Ultimately the writing is just so ... lacking.
And Just Like That...,0,"We recognize these characters, but it's not just someone at the table who's missing - it's an energy."
Squid Game,0,"The low-effort concept [and] the pastel palette freckled with blood, Squid Game is a shallow story that uses a social issue as a platform for shocking violence. Yawn."
Community,0,it's hard to shake the feeling that Community's continued existence has taken precedence over purpose. It's an overall diminishment that isn't helped by the shrinking cast.
Hawkeye,0,"For a series about a pair of sharpshooters, Hawkeye frustratingly misses the mark too often. Well, at least for viewers who aren't its target audience."
The Twilight Zone,0,It's a tough look that the new season's three episodes screened for critics in advance was also its safest and most conventional.
Lovecraft Country,0,"Right now, between the messy narrative, bendable rules, and buckets of blood, it's just too hard to get a grip on ""Lovecraft Country."""
The Undoing,0,"HBO assembled an A-team, but failed to match them to a project worthy of their talents."
Inside Amy Schumer,0,"Even though what I've seen of season four isn't quite as funny as I'd like it to be, I hope that Schumer's benign tyranny of mainstreaming feminism isn't ending anytime soon."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"Though it began as the one Marvel/Netflix series with the most potential, Jessica Jones has seen its quality dip precipitously with each subsequent season."
The Thing About Pam,0,"A watchable if often underwhelming true crime docudrama that wants to both be weird and play it safe, ending up in a strange middle ground between the two."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,It's not only that Kelley has gussied up the average Californian spa menu in such a way that everything seems silly rather than satirical. The more he lays on the mysteries and the secrets... the less compelling it all feels.
X-Men,0,The series fizzled to an end.
Suspicion,0,"It feels like Suspicion is a bunch of espionage scenes in search of a cohesive story. The story may reveal itself at some point, but right now, the whole operation feels bland and generic."
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,Perhaps the worst offender yet of the Netflix/Marvel drama approach of filling up a 13-episode bag with only three or four episodes' worth of story at best.
True Detective,0,This season's attempt to bring back the old True Detective magic also feels a bit stale.
RENO 911!,0,"Unfortunately, that same sense of nostalgic comfort is also the show's greatest weakness; for better and for worse, the show (and its sense of humor) hasn't changed a whit since it went off the air in 2009."
The Book of Boba Fett,0,The Book of Boba Fett was a series of compounding mistakes. Its best feature was to deliver a Mandalorian sequel that could have been a self-contained film.
The Haunting of Hill House,0,I found it perplexing and eventually irritating.
Halo,0,"iHaloi looks a lot like well you might expect an adaptation of the game would, but it fails to distinguish itself from similar sci-fi fare."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,Anatomy of a Scandal most resembles a soap opera you’d watch in order to have something on in the background. But the ultra-serious subject matter make it an impossible mindless watch.
Inventing Anna,0,"In trying to make the show about gossip and the media, Inventing Anna actually misses whatever it is that Anna herself was up to and rather focused on what she thought she was doing. Instead of adding complexity, it just comes off as muddled."
The First Lady,0,"The message that these women overcame barriers is hammered home, so that their heroism is never in doubt, never challenged along the way. That’s no fun."
The Witcher,0,"The Witcher plods along on its wayward course, piling on complications that, by and large, fail to consistently create the type of urgent stakes-or sense of import."
Ginny & Georgia,0,"There's a decent YA show in here somewhere, but along with its abundance of plot, Ginny & Georgia needs to step away from the plethora of Gilmore Girls references to get there."
Scandal,0,It's unsettling to follow - it doesn't feel like the same Scandal we've grown to love.
Love Life,0,"No matter how much you can appreciate the character's journey, it's not easy for any actor to carry this type of story, but Harper would make you believe otherwise. Here's hoping he gets even better material moving forward."
Turner & Hooch,0,"I'm not even complaining when I call Turner & Hooch a forgettable, one-joke series. It's hard to know what else it could have been."
Fargo,0,"Outsize characterizations are not new for ""Fargo,"" but a balance has been lost here, with many characters standing in for the grandest sorts of evil and too few giving us what the series at its best possesses - soulfulness."
The Office,0,"The Office definitively answers a few key questions about the cogs at the middling paper company Dunder Mifflin - if anyone out there is still interested in the once smart, now just silly sitcom."
Bridgerton,0,"The hit series Bridgerton returns with diminished swagger. Not only has The Gilded Age taken the lead on lavish costumes and set decoration, the new season begins with considerably less heat and a tendency to the ridiculous."
Arrested Development,0,"The Bluths are a terrible lot, and the show never lets us forget it, but there's something cruel, and boring, about continuing to harp on Buster's otherness."
The Beatles: Get Back,0,"The Beatles: Get Back only truly comes to life when the eponymous band performs, and it happens far less than you might want over the course of 8 hours."
First Kill,0,"The one-line description -- Romeo and Juliet, only adapted here as the crucifix-crossed romance between a vampire and a vampire slayer -- seems ripe for mockery, and the execution doesn't do much to blunt it."
The White Lotus,0,"Natasha Rothwell's Belinda is the most likable and human character, but her story arc is far too predictable and often gets lost in the dark hijinks..."
Loki,0,It's nevertheless a bit of a letdown when you realize halfway through the dense first episode that one of the MCU's ostensibly most unpredictable lead characters has somehow landed in the most predictable of setups.
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Atill struggling with the same generic Marvel-on-Netflix issue: a master plot that just isn't dense enough to stretch over the episode order, leading to stop-and-start pacing, repetitive conversations and secondary characters that overstay their welcome."
Star Wars: Visions,0,"If ""Star Wars: Visions"" does nothing else, it at least tells the story that, if only in part it's an important part, that the long time ago and the galaxy far away was maybe the Tokugawa era in feudal Japan."
Lost,0,"Lost crashed, and crashed hard... This season wasn't a long con. It was a weak trick."
The White Lotus,0,"What's lifted up are all of the critiques of sexism, racism, and classism. What's cancelled are the sources of these critiques, which are predominately POCs. And what's preserved is the hetero white male dominance of capitalism."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,0,"Like the Don't Bothers - like the show itself, really - she's in there swinging, but doesn't score very often."
Castle Rock,0,"There are so many threads being woven together, and try as they might, there's just not enough knots being tied to make it all work. In the end, everyone suffers, and we're left with cheeky references, hollow drama, and zero stakes."
Sex/Life,0,"For a show about the basic instincts, it's unusually removed from anything recognizably human; for a look at what it means to heedlessly seek fulfillment, it's surprisingly sour and mean."
Prison Break,0,"More than a new installment of Prison Break, this season feels a bit like Homeland For Dummies, with the political intrigue and intelligence-community backstabbing brought down to a grade-school level."
Little Voice,0,Never tries something original when a cliché will do instead.
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"If only time travel were real, they could use it to go back and do it right."
Coyote,0,To be blunt: a show that asks its audience to connect to a rogue Border Patrol agent with literal blood on his hands needs to work harder than this one does to justify its premise.
And Just Like That...,0,Introducing a cross-section of different types of recurring characters -- love. Feeling like the series creators had a checklist of representation token boxes to check off... it's all trying way too hard -- hate.
Devs,0,"While I can appreciate the stark beauty of the series, there is a pervading sense of dread that I found thoroughly unpleasant... Devs feels like the kind of show that will be a game-changer for many. But I'm not one of them."
Halo,0,"Those of us who don’t recognise every re-enacted power-up bleep and helmet-cam vision of destruction will probably find ourselves wondering, much of the time, quite what is going on."
Battlestar Galactica,0,A lot of basic and mundane things don't add up for me.
The Morning Show,0,"If the first season was about the Me Too movement, the second season is about... well, I'm not sure really. The show says so much without saying anything at all."
House of Cards,0,"Artistically, Season 6 of House of Cards is a flop."
Deadwood,0,It's like saddling up and putting the spurs to a drunk Shetland pony.
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"A dour, flavorless combination of familiar crime-drama elements, led by Renner at his most glum."
Naomi,0,"On both the teen and super aspects, this series misses the mark."
Suspicion,0,Suspicion is a show consistently filled with incident it can sometimes trick you into thinking it is complex.
His Dark Materials,0,"For a story centered on the exploits of a frightened, isolated teenager, the show remains remarkably devoid of any sense of fear, excitement, or passion."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"As it nears the end of its run, the series doesn't seem to have much more to say about trauma."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"If we could get high enough, maybe we could see some reason to sit through this Disneyfied pastiche of Lewis Carroll and ""1,001 Nights."" Or maybe not."
The X-Files,0,It's time for the veteran creator to let others find the truth out there.
Tokyo Vice,0,"After that first episode ends, and Mann hands off the show to other directors, an impression starts to build that the best ""Vice'' has to offer is behind it."
Lovecraft Country,0,"Lovecraft Country is within its rights to use people as a vehicle for a story, rather than vice versa-but the story has to be considered and focused enough to be worth the trade-off."
Foundation,0,"Foundation attempts to achieve as many plot points as possible from the beginning, which is concerning early on. Hopefully, the jittery exposition is only served to launch the series, and the story improves from here."
Slow Horses,0,This spy thriller hitches its wagon to an insufferable performance.
Big Little Lies,0,"As good as the cast was, they couldn't quite lift Big Little Lies above the ordinary."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Masha's a megalomaniac who can't help playing god when given the chance. But she feels increasingly generic as the series chugs along, flattening from a female Keith Raniere to a life-size cardboard cutout of him."
WeCrashed,0,"However great Hathaway and Leto are, though, at portraying these insufferable people, the fact remains that we have to watch these people be insufferable..."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"Fox's delusions grow to the point where it's sometimes hard to believe what's happening, and it makes less of a statement about consumerism and the dangers of a free market than it, as I said already, does the Walter White thing in a misfired manner"
The Mosquito Coast,0,"The most prescient thing this version of The Mosquito Coast has to say about capitalism is how quickly it morphs into a knockoff of Breaking Bad and Ozark, repackaging a primetime TV template to bring an old story to a new audience."
The Wheel of Time,0,"Shows like The Wheel of Time feel reverse-engineered from an ideal outcome. And, unlike in fantasies, prophecies in the real world aren't guaranteed to come true..."
The Queen's Gambit,0,"It is a show that takes itself so seriously that, when former child actor Thomas Brodie-Sangster turns up dressed like an escapee from the Wild West, you don't know whether it's meant to be funny or not"
The Boys,0,"Its bleak viewing experience might appeal to some audiences, but it’s likely to leave more than a few viewers wishing the entire cast of characters would just be put out of their misery."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,The story fails to convince that the couple shares much more than an understanding of the obstacles keeping them apart. So much time is spent on establishing the rules of this show’s game that there’s little room to play.
Invasion,0,Invasion is a slow burn that threatens to become simply slow.
The Morning Show,0,"Why [It] feels so committed to giving Mitch's bland, predictable, ""old guard"" point of view equal weight to those of supposed gamechangers like Alex and Bradley is part of a larger problem surrounding the show's relationship to power."
Amazing Stories,0,"The opening episode is a story, certainly, but it isn't remotely amazing. Steven Spielberg's revival of his Eighties anthology series has been keenly awaited by viewers of a certain vintage. They are doomed to be disappointed."
God's Favorite Idiot,0,"God’s Favorite Idiot is just sad. What a waste of precious time in the career of a talented performer, one whose fans will follow her anywhere, and who rewards them with so little of what she can do."
Night Sky,0,"The show trips over its length -- Night Sky is built around a decent idea for a 100-minute movie, which it then stretches to eight hours."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,0,"What audiences get is a family melodrama where mental illness is addressed on the way to another destination. There’s no doubting the sincerity of those involved, but ultimately this glossy slice of streaming content lacks teeth in its latter stages..."
And Just Like That...,0,"Theres still lots of ardor for New York City (which is nice, especially post-pandemic) in And Just Like That, but there is nothing sexy about it."
The Nevers,0,"If The Nevers does get to continue, having someone else in charge could be the special power it really needs."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"The series rapidly hops between decades but feels like it moves at a crawl, dulling the myriad charms of its leading cast."
Godless,0,"Godless, with its cinematic longshots of unfettered Western plains, a moody and effective soundtrack, and a phenomenal cast, seemed destined for greatness. But unfortunately, the town of La Belle isn't just lawless - it's also a bit aimless."
Lovecraft Country,0,"A by-the-numbers story that wants to be bold and daring, and in so doing ends up not engaging with its own strongest elements."
The Thing About Pam,0,"Even over six episodes, this series is far too long and not worth the effort that Renee Zellweger puts into playing the title character."
Vikings: Valhalla,0,"If youre just here to up the historical combat quotient in your screen diet, have at it. But dont expect much else."
The Stand,0,"There's potential for this story to resonate very strongly with audiences at this moment in history, but the decision to present it out of chronological order puts everything it has to offer at risk."
Heroes,0,"Once again, then, an error-riddled and confusingly-plotted episode of Heroes where everyone acted out of character, which, by this point, can be considered entirely consistent with their previous appearances."
Moon Knight,0,"The rickety action sequences, paired with questionable CGI, drippy horror, terrible jokes, a shoddily assembled mystery and one too many rounds of over-the-top violence combine to make Moon Knight an unfortunate dud on the Marvel roster."
Girls,0,"Girls was insistently offbeat, and in defiance of TV convention, a character study more than an ensemble piece - even if it wasn't quite willing to admit that."
Little Voice,0,"It can be a little wearing over the seasonal long haul, but it is true in its way to our sentimental experience and why nothing succeeds in working us up, and working us over, quite like a pop song."
Waco,0,"Waco has done far more ironing out than enriching in the episodes leading up to next week's grand finale. The Dowdles have hamstrung their own ambitions, reducing Waco from a reckoning with the muddled past to an oversimplification of it."
Queer as Folk,0,"Queer as Folk always felt dangerous and interesting, as if we were peeking in on a world we shouldn’t. The reboot feels jaded, as if we are watching things we’ve seen a hundred times before."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Little fires will quickly merge into an overwhelming flame, and even though this is the first scene of the series, Hulu's adaptation goes right ahead and burns itself out."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"I can only speak for myself, but I don't have the patience for this anymore. At least Breaking Bad had the decency to make Walter White a tame family man before he went gonzo."
First Kill,0,"A dull, predictable Buffy the Vampire Slayer knock-off."
Black Sails,0,"Though there are hints of better things to come, the early goings of Black Sails season 4 are light on fun and adventure."
True Detective,0,True Detective falls prey to a slightly milder case of misogyny than afflicted it in season one.
Invasion,0,"For all that money, we might have expected more. The plotting is occasionally a letdown too, bordering on infuriating."
Sex/Life,0,Sex/Life is about as sexy as running a UV wand through a cheap motel room that hasn't changed its mattress in seven years.
The Stand,0,"While it may sound as if this would be particularly frightening to watch right now, the truth is that this much-awaited series is a bit of an anti-climax."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"This show seems to revel in its clichés rather than deconstructing them ... mostly, it settles for being bland and tasteful."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Only one person in this fiasco is any good: the ever-brilliant Joshua McGuire, as Chris Clarke, a Downing Street communications chief."
Inside Amy Schumer,0,"There are jokes about what it means to be an everyday woman, but they're sprinkled in among jokes about what it must be like to be Amy Schumer, and it messes with the voice of the show."
Big Little Lies,0,"But by the end of season two of Big Little Lies, I not only didn't fully get what I wanted from it, I didn't feel like I got what I needed, either."
Moon Knight,0,"The 1st episode is fantastic, but the quality quickly drops off.  Steven is fun but Isaac makes the other personality, Marc, quite boring. Moon Knight & his mythology are sloppily defined,  making it hard to get excited about this new addition to the MCU."
Earth to Ned,0,Alien puppet talk show falls short of Muppet expectations.
Safe,0,"[Michael C.] Hall's accent, reasonably consistent and yet rarely believable, is one of many things on Safe that are askew and, the more I think about it, the more I can't tell if it's intentional if not particularly satisfying, or merely bad."
WeCrashed,0,
Pieces of Her,0,"If, like me, you want something deeper, you’ll find Pieces of Her’s biggest mystery will be how this tonally mismatched, structurally messy show came to be."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"The show's signature fight scenes are still fantastic, as is the Punisher himself, Jon Bernthal. But something seemed to go wrong in the writers' room this go-round."
The Nevers,0,Astonishingly pedestrian.
Foundation,0,"I find myself less enthusiastic about spending hours watching a series gear up for the good stuff, especially when the material is as sombre as this."
The Offer,0,"Viewers would be better off watching the Godfather saga, as its a better use of their time  and its far more entertaining than the entirety of this series."
Tokyo Vice,0,What would Japanese people do without Americans around to explain everything to them?
Game of Thrones,0,"Season 8 doesn't feel like it was earned, with too little time dedicated to growing characters paired with a greater emphasis on rushing to major plot points, rather than proving to those of us watching how inevitable they were."
Outer Range,0,"Outer Range is a lumbering, self-serious hodgepodge of sci-fi and modern Western."
Y: The Last Man,0,"Having so many leads dilutes the emotional impact, with the chaos of the unknown acting as a low-level threat that's annoying more than devastating."
Suspicion,0,"Suspicion is convinced of its own cleverness and righteousness, but very little over the course of its eight episodes provides any evidence for either."
Star Trek,0,The less said about the reduced-budget third season the better.
The Sex Lives of College Girls,0,"We've seen better depictions of college misadventures, and while most aren't as realistically inclusive as this one, neither are their mechanics as obvious."
WandaVision,0,It's like plugging through porridge for the chocolate button at the bottom of every bowl.
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"This could have been the second genuinely remarkable series for Hulu. Instead it remains stuck in second gear, with many episodes feeling longer than they are as Elena's upsetting choices endlessly pile on."
WeCrashed,0,"The show seems overtly fascinated with Adam Neumann's con... but the consequences of his financial shell-game (many of which fell on his overworked, underpaid workforce) are largely treated as an afterthought."
Joe vs Carole,0,"It isn't particularly entertaining, but chances are Joe vs. Carole will succeed at making you wonder why the series was even produced, let alone stretched over eight episodes."
The Bletchley Circle,0,"Still fun on its own terms, the encore takes an unexpected little gem and transforms it into Murder, She (and She and She and She) Wrote."
11.22.63,0,"The resulting eight-part miniseries is an uneven affair, at times feeling as if it's meandering through history en route to its frantic closing kick."
Ozark,0,The final episodes were just awful. Everything that kept me from really bonding with the series about a family breaking bad was on display in those last hours.
His Dark Materials,0,"It's hard to imagine any teenage fan of fantasy adventure, raised on Star Wars and superhero movies, sitting through even ten minutes of this coalescing sludge."
The Flight Attendant,0,"I never understood the appeal of The Flight Attendant, and I still don't."
Joe vs Carole,0,You can see why Tiger Kings initial mass popular appeal lead to this drama being pitched  its a lot more difficult to see why anyone thought that appeal might sustain during the time it actually takes to make eight hours of television.
Curb Your Enthusiasm,0,"The whimsy on the show is now so ethereal it barely registers. The setups can be achingly obvious and the punchlines disappointing. Besides, an ever more elderly Larry David as a single guy ambling round LA is getting tiresome."
Little Voice,0,The stakes are ludicrously low.
Swagger,0,"Every possible sports cliché lands with a thud, the dialogue is clunky and the attempt to frame the story as a rebellion against racism falls flat."
True Detective,0,"It is neither as raw and gripping as the series' rookie season nor as structurally unsound as its second. It is good, not great."
Taboo,0,"What it lacks, unfortunately, is Thrones' sweep, moments of playfulness and narrative drive - or any drive at all."
Game of Thrones,0,"I don't think anyone can be happy that this season focused, in the end, on Jon Snow, the least complicated main character on an ensemble full of brutal instincts and grasping ambition."
Looking for Alaska,0,"Though its cast is immensely likable and more than up to the task at hand, this limited series never manages to fill the characters or its narrative with enough emotional depth to accomplish what it's trying to."
Foundation,0,"We'd love to see the parts that show the story's humanity and hope, but the first episode was just too boring to draw us in."
Lisey's Story,0,"The porousness of the action becomes frustrating and, ultimately, off-putting. I don't mind being toyed with by a show; I don't need strict linearity. But the willful swirl and the withholding of coherence are too extreme here."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,0,Stewart is a terrific interviewer but the show doesn't yet feel as fun or authoritative as Last Week Tonight.
Turner & Hooch,0,"Even if Hooch sits at attention like a good dog, after a few episodes of Turner & Hooch, it's hard to share that patience or loyalty."
Scandal,0,"Looking back, the real Scandal was that anyone kept watching."
Foundation,0,"There is no saga too epic for a little levity, and here it might have made some of the characters more believable. It might even have made me want to wade through the complexity."
Lisey's Story,0,"Lisey's Story has the distinct feel of something that has been created by a bunch of men who haven't been told 'no' in quite some time. Ultimately, it is a woman who pays for their overindulgence."
Treadstone,0,"While the action in Treadstone is great, there just isn't enough plot to make a satisfying watch."
Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,0,Much of what the series offers can’t help but come off as clever franchise strategizing.
Big Little Lies,0,"With more empathetic writing, Bonnie could have been the emotional anchor of season two."
Schmigadoon!,0,It's one of those comedies that works well enough at the moment and only loses the melody when one considers how great it could and should have been.
Night Sky,0,More of an exercise in frustration than anything else.
Monsters at Work,0,"Bafflingly, it's a workplace comedy. Note to Disney: children don't go to work."
The Mandalorian,0,"Any attempt to create new characters like Werner Herzog's mysterious Client or Taika Waititi's IG-11 droid are thrown out of the window, with the makers taking the lazier step of filling the world with existing characters."
Waco,0,"What Waco needs, and fails to achieve, is a complex, unified theory of Koresh."
Big Little Lies,0,"HBO, determined to win some more Emmys, and replicate the lighting-in-a-bottle brilliance that was season one, made a season that fails to justify its existence."
The Morning Show,0,It's clear that whoever is writing the loaded conversations between these characters has never participated in one of their own to learn that this is simply not how we talk about any of it.
Ozark,0,All of this generates incident. But little has the heat of real drama.
Suspicion,0,"Based on the Israeli series False Flag, the show devolves into a strange hybrid that’s neither tense nor particularly logical."
Waco,0,"The intimate humanization of Koresh and his followers comes across as a pure defense, a vindication of the rights of fringe groups to exist with huge stockpiles of guns without attracting the eye of law enforcement."
The Outsider,0,"Slowness, however, is not the issue; nor does it seem right to peg it all on tone. The characters keep remarking that something just doesn't add up. It's as if they're writing this review themselves."
The Endgame,0,"The Endgame is the sort of show that believes it can compete with an international hit like Money Heist by staging seven simultaneous bank takeovers, while giving us precious little reason to care what happens in any of them."
Coyote,0,Assembled from spare parts left over from previous television trends and decaying prejudices.
What If...?,0,"[What If...? is] bite-sized chunks of comic book fun, however [the show doesn't] go further than being half-hearted fan service."
The O.C.,0,"As is perhaps fitting, though, for a show about teenagers and their notoriously short attention spans, the writers found it hard to keep up the momentum and the quality took a dive... It has been clear the show is on its last legs."
Shining Girls,0,Too many threads are left dangling or unexplained. You never get that satisfying feeling of everything clicking into place by the end.
Y: The Last Man,0,"t takes the swashbuckling, humorous tone of the source material and trades it in for a generic end-of-the-world ominousness that makes it seem like a forgotten season of The Walking Dead."
Peacemaker,0,"In contrast with the amusing 'Suicide Squad,' in James Gunn's ""Peacemaker"" limited series, the obnoxious, vainglorious anti-hero is the entire song, and it's a grating note that wears out its welcome incredibly fast."
Lisey's Story,0,"Acknowledging its prettiness and production values, and some excellent performances, I found it better than unbearable but something less than beautiful."
13 Reasons Why,0,The empathy of the first season has vanished completely. [Full Review in Spanish]
What If...?,0,"A galaxy-level cast, for a TikTok-level Disney+ series. [Marvel's] first animated series [...] allows it to operate on a different canvas [but] the first three episodes don't push the envelope. What If...? feels like a footnote in the MCU encyclopaedia."
Night Sky,0,"It gets off to a touching start only to wind up tangled in its own narrative weeds, straying into multiple storylines that takes us away from what was working so well — the relationship between the two leads."
Marvel's Daredevil,0,Where does this go from here? Can Daredevil survive a fourth season? Or is it time for the character to hang up his horns for good?
Foundation,0,"While shows don't need to hold our hands or slowly spoon-feed us information, they do need to help us follow along. No one enjoys feeling like they're missing something, but that's exactly what happens as you sit down to watch these episodes."
Joe vs Carole,0,"The series doesn’t know exactly what tone it wants to take. It kinda wants to be camp, but it kinda wants to be taken seriously, it kinda wants to give you just the facts ma’am, but it also kind of wants to show you different sides of these characters."
Preacher,0,The back half of Preacher will have to pull a miracle out of the bag for this not to be remembered as a disappointment and a missed opportunity.
The Essex Serpent,0,"The pacing is slow, and rather than feeling meditative or breathable, The Essex Serpent only feels mechanical, ploddingly carrying the plot forward scene to scene. Whatever electricity the leads’ performances could have lent it is thoroughly deadened."
Moon Knight,0,"It ends up feeling both bloated and disposable, something that ultimately has no great purpose to exist other than as another piece of content thrown into the jaws of the Disney+ machine."
Lincoln's Dilemma,0,"For the first 3 1/2 episodes, the filmmakers and contributing scholars do a reasonably good job of appearing unbiased...Where they drop the ball in a major way is in the last 15 minutes when their unabashed, vainglorious stripes are revealed."
Schmigadoon!,0,"Simply put, it's sporadically fun but a little too cute for its own good."
The First,0,"Only near the very end does ""The First"" strap in for another go, after viewers have endured far too much narrative flourish."
The Book of Boba Fett,0,Let's hope that the dramatic intensity and action scenes grow in the final four installments.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,0,"I... didn't really like this season. More clunkers than good episodes, but ""Chosen"" still stands as one of the best series finales I've ever seen."
Westworld,0,"Will it all come together in a way that’s narratively sensible and emotionally satisfying? Fool me thrice, shame on me. Fool me four times, shame on Westworld."
Invasion,0,"Invasion is a ten-hour season devoid of nearly all humor, where characters across the globe continually bumble around in their own misery, resentful that aliens keep interrupting their tragic lives."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,Why are we coming back to all these people again?
Sharp Objects,0,"Vallée seems more interested in making everything look ""dark,"" rather than let his fantastic actors take us through their emotional journey."
Amazing Stories,0,"Optimism isn't a bad thing to have on TV shows, but when that's the only thing you've got going for you, living up to ""amazing"" seems like a reach."
Halo,0,"Ultimately, Halo’s alien problem feels like a symptom of the show’s biggest problem.It is so deeply incurious about the ideas defining these characters’ lives that they become virtually meaningless."
The Act,0,"Like many miniseries, the show suffers from pacing issues, hitting the same beats repeatedly to the point of frustration."
They Call Me Magic,0,"If viewers don’t already know the stories Johnson has previously told, they’ll come away either feeling like Magic was pretty boring or like the truth was pretty boring."
The Right Stuff,0,The story crawls along incrementally without using all that time to let us know its characters as anything but the broadest of archetypes.
The Undoing,0,The real disappointment lies in the degree to which The Undoing shows itself to be simply a cheesy thriller.
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Iron Fist Season 2 marks an improvement over its well-derided freshman run, but still lacks punch."
The Right Stuff,0,The Right Stuff is inoffensively bland.
Homeland,0,"Medically speaking, it's probably inadvisable to treat bipolarity as a superpower. But that's where we are."
First Kill,0,"For all the work First Kill puts into making sure it hits all the right notes, the series feels more like an uncanny valley version of what it’s attempting to be rather than a worthwhile story all its own."
Inventing Anna,0,"In the end, both the main characters remain somewhat opaque, because they’re defined less by their specific goals than by the nebulous act of wanting."
The Right Stuff,0,"There's not a lot of wonder or enthusiasm to this version of The Right Stuff, which mostly treats the space program as a grim endurance test."
Entourage,0,"Everything that went down on screen in this finale felt rushed, it was almost like no one bothered to tell the writers that they only had eight episodes this season and once they realised they had to squash episodes worth of material in to one half hour."
The First,0,"[Tom] acts like a complex hero in this post-""Sopranos"" era, but the aimless writing and the arty editing leave him flat."
Brave New World,0,"[Brave New World] could have gone in any wild direction it wanted, but it opted for a take that feels like the safest possible outcome."
Bridgerton,0,"The real scandal of Bridgerton: Try as it might, it’s no substitute for Jane Austen."
The Twilight Zone,0,"Technophobic and misogynistic... you're better than this, Twilight Zone."
The First Lady,0,"If ""The First Lady"" gets another season itll need to find a way to create compelling narratives for all its leads and be unafraid to get into the mess that is the White House."
Inventing Anna,0,"An overwrought, overlong mess, with writing and performances that feel too over the top even for a soap opera."
Rise,0,"Mr. Radnor is not convincing -- or he is, but in the wrong ways."
The Book of Boba Fett,0,"Favreau scattered story crumbs onto the table and expected hungry viewers to squish them together and call it cake... It's a short-term high, but I believe this business is going destroy this franchise expansion if it's replicated in the spinoffs to come."
His Dark Materials,0,"[Though] it's timely and relevant in places, His Dark Materials season 2 can't shake off the feeling everything it attempts has been done better elsewhere before."
Taboo,0,The series itself dives into bewildering sojourns through memory. . .or is it fantasy?. . . showing tribespeople with painted faces and bizarre asides in which James whispers in unfamiliar tongues to unseen forces.
Altered Carbon,0,"This season lays hard into the sci-fi and moves away from the stronger narrative ties that would lend the story to its noir roots. While still a cool show hiring dope and diverse actors, I can't help but want more from the show."
Big Shot,0,"Big Shot, while perfectly amiable in most respects, often fails to sweat the details in the way that a tough coach would demand."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"The bottom line is Apple has produced a series that not only fails to get under your skin, but mostly just makes you want to swat it away."
Weeds,0,I'm pretty sure there aren't drugs strong enough to get me to the bittersweet end of this series.
A Teacher,0,"At a time when TV embraces inventive and risky storytelling, ""A Teacher"" looks and feels like something that belonged on cable 10 years ago."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"If The White Lotus is 30 Rock, then Nine Perfect Strangers is Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip: not ""good,"" exactly, and definitely way overblown, but still watchable in its own strange way."
The Nevers,0,"The anchor on The Nevers is that it never seems to take off, at least from the episodes I've seen... For now, The Nevers never will do."
Godless,0,Godless has a great throwback Western movie buried somewhere under all the excess flab.
Limitless,0,"This is a mediocre rehash of Intelligence, which was already a humorless rip off of Chuck."
11.22.63,0,"11.22.63 sets forth with a fascinating premise, but gets a little too distracted by superfluous material that only causes it to get sidetracked from the main plot, resulting in a slightly unfocused show with problematic execution."
The First,0,Packed with corny symbolism and inexplicable cutaways.
Suits,0,It was about as middle of the road and predictable as to be expected from Suits.
Twin Peaks,0,"It's hard not to feel like I've been completely, utterly duped. The two-hour kickoff did not repair the damage wrought by Season 2. If anything, it was like taking a sip of damn fine coffee after learning that someone had stuck a fish in the pot."
Ginny & Georgia,0,"The script's plotholes... [starts] so many stories that, in the dent, it doesn't end up providing the screen time that each one deserves. [Full review in Spanish]"
Lisey's Story,0,Lisey's Story is a mess in almost every conceivable way.
Taboo,0,"Taboo is not so much a show as it is an ordeal, a slog through a miasma of squalid period clichés that's possibly even less inviting than last season's FX vanity production, The Bastard Executioner."
Brave New World,0,"Despite some evocative (and provocative) visuals and appropriate dramatic tension, it fails to truly excite."
Defending Jacob,0,The worst thing about Apple TV+'s new limited series Defending Jacob is that it feels like every other crime series we've seen before.
The Good Wife,0,"""End"" had moments that worked but never came together on the whole."
Behind Her Eyes,0,Where others excel with the dark and twisty storylines building intrigue and frightening sequences this one is only good for mustering up a sleepy yawn.
The Fall,0,"As good as Anderson is throughout, her Stella suffers from a Season 3 lack of development -- we learn nothing about her in this new season that we did not know from the previous two."
Wolf Like Me,0,The first three episodes mildly intrigued me – but not enough to want to continue.
Star Wars: Visions,0,"While some episodes have good elements, overall it's just too uneven. It also doesn't feel enough like Star Wars. But kudos to Lucasfilm for trying something different."
The First,0,"The show has a bland, sanitized feel, no matter how hard its cheesy score tries to heighten the inspiration at every turn. The best sci-fi stories, underneath the robots and space flights, are great human stories."
Lovecraft Country,0,"The new HBO series isn't interested in torquing the qualities of what's called Lovecraftian, nor inheriting them-and its episodes are weighted down by historical annotations and clumsy exposition."
The Offer,0,"While The Offer is an intermittently entertaining fictionalization about the making of the greatest movie of all time, your time would be far better spent re-watching the greatest movie of all time and the greatest sequel ever."
24,0,This 24 revival seems motivated by more pragmatic and mercenary considerations: trying to wring a few more nuggets out of a played-out goldmine.
The Capture,0,"The series sucks the juice out of its pop-cultural reference points, failing to mine our current nightmares on its own terms."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"The new Hulu drama has everything going for it, which makes its failures even more striking."
And Just Like That...,0,"A woke pamphlet…electing to preach about how the world works.
[Full review in Spanish]"
Cheers,0,Yuk. Writers Glen Charles and Les Charles crammed more sloppy sentimental stuff into the last 15 minutes of Thursday's finale than the show exhibited in its entire 11 years.
Lost,0,"It became a show about placating, even sedating, fans, convincing them that, in the absence of anything coherent or challenging, love was enough."
P-Valley,0,"P-Valley pivots almost exclusively toward anguish and the tension between crime and punishment, and that thematic swing... overwhelms and undermines already-established plots."
The First,0,"Providing all the attendant pageantry and triumphant music and inspirational speeches you might expect, before shifting back to the glummest, slowest, least enthusiastic approach possible to the material."
House of Cards,0,"The final season of House of Cards is too weird and atonal to ignore completely, but it's not good enough to recommend."
Joe vs Carole,0,"It's never ideal to arrive way too late to the party, and Joe vs Carole feels guilty of that, adapting the story of Netflix's Tiger King, a.k.a. Joe Exotic, into a limited series that dutifully replicates those events without much bite."
True Detective,0,"A thin story spread over a lot of hours, but Ali is excellent and so is his support."
Man vs. Bee,0,There’s something dispiriting about Atkinson’s determination to play idiotic characters incapable of accomplishing routine tasks without burning down the house or ruining very valuable works of art
Twin Peaks,0,"Yes, it's weird. Yes, it's ""Lynchian."" But there's a lot more weirdness on TV than there was in 1990."
WandaVision,0,"It feels empty and aimless, like the writers wanted an avenue to play with the TV eras, but didn't think hard enough about how to make WandaVision independent of the past."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"The title, and the blueprints from other shows, seem disposable, or at least casually, even wastefully transposable. How predictably American, Allie Fox would probably think."
Rise,0,"Rise is not the next Friday Night Lights, or even the next great teen drama. It's more like Friday Night Lite."
Black Mirror,0,"Brooker still has the teeth - and the imagination to craft tales that link into our techno-paranoia, showing us a world gone wrong where we are not too careful - but the bite is somewhat lacking."
Safe,0,There are few series on streaming or anywhere else that will cause as few ripples.
Amazing Stories,0,"It's too early to tell for sure, but the only amazing thing about ""Amazing Stories"" so far is that the new version retained and updated the original opening sequence, complete with that exciting musical theme by John Williams."
The First,0,"For a show about people looking up to the stars in wonder, its gaze is disappointingly earthbound."
Inventing Anna,0,"While it may tell Annas story, it does so in the most basic, bare-bones manner, devoid of any real personality, fire, or even genuinely compelling characters  thanks mostly in part to the shows (sometimes painfully) lackluster scripts."
Black Mirror,0,"It's weird to feel so poorly about three arguably good episodes of television, but the short length of Season 5 only serves to highlight the deficiencies of the season as a whole."
Brave New World,0,"Brave New World is caught in a feedback loop of references, one that only occasionally resonates with a culture in the midst of challenging systems, unseen and otherwise."
Six Feet Under,0,"Now I've had it with people who insist on making themselves miserable, as if it were an art."
Defending Jacob,0,Underneath this tale... is pretty standard fare and about two hundred minutes too long.
The Wire,0,"Though interesting at times, the fictionalized account of The Baltimore Sun lacks the depth of the institutions depicted in seasons past."
Brave New World,0,"""Antiseptic"" doesn't begin to describe it."
Lovecraft Country,0,"There's something mechanical about Lovecraft Country's horror, both real and supernatural."
Entourage,0,Entourage completely lost sight of what it was.
The Thing About Pam,0,It's a true-crime experiment that clearly wants to be the next Fargo and doesn't get there.
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,My real problem with Scandal isn’t that it’s trashy or muddled in its message. I was mostly lost wondering who to care about... What’s really missing in this Anatomy lesson is its soul.
Game of Thrones,0,"Season 8 reduced characters to caricatures, didn't earn its character development and the shift in their arcs, baked in several plot holes, and did away with internal logic and consistency."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Despite risible dialogue and a disturbing swing toward cheap theatrics, this weak but watchable legal thriller still puts a human face on the MeToo movement thanks to committed, compelling performances from Sienna Miller and Michelle Dockery."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,0,The series fails to recognize the key to the power of its source material: its peculiarity.
How I Met Your Mother,0,This finale seems to completely sour the show's legacy - something that is not more important than ever.
Black Mirror,0,"The three episodes combine, however, to make for a slight and overly long viewing experience."
Invasion,0,It's nothing but a kitchen sink drama as people are running and seeing weird things happening.
The Me You Can't See,0,"There is no doubt that every contributor's motives here were pure. But standing outside and looking at the programme as an artefact and an influence on debate, one might ask whether sharing stories always means giving back"
Prison Break,0,"In a particularly generous (or perverse) move, Fox is giving us not just a dead show or a dead character, but a two-for-one sale."
The Outsider,0,"""The Outsider"" takes an entertaining and propulsive, if routine, read and renders it with style and savvy but not much of a pulse."
The Stand,0,"This new version has its inspired moments, like the way Billy Joel's ""The Stranger"" somehow turns out to be the perfect theme song for Flagg, but the structure keeps sucking the life out of things, from major characters to more minor ones."
Starstruck,0,Haven’t we already been here? Are there not new dilemmas from which to mine comedy?
Boardwalk Empire,0,"Every minute spent in Cuba drags the pacing to a crawl, even by this show's pacing standards."
Entourage,0,"Entourage feels awfully washed-out and washed-up, kind of like Vince Chase's dormant career, as the show counts down to the end."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"The way Ike silkily asserts control over Marty's life, and why Marty was susceptible to it, is a key element to all of this. But the show's approach is weirdly miscalculated."
Gaslit,0,"The entire time I watched Gaslit, I ricocheted between thinking it was a thought-provoking series full of memorable performances and that it was a terrible series that too frequently felt like a Saturday Night Live skit."
Reacher,0,"Ritchson's 12-pack is a physical manifestation of a tonal problem: His Reacher is smarmy and pleased with himself, rather than casually secure in his own vast abilities. He's a generic vigilante who just happens to look like a mountain."
The Outsider,0,"Like the Stephen King novel it's based upon, The Outsider is an interesting, but not completely satisfying experiment... Even with Erivo and Mendelsohn as sturdy stars, ]it] hasn't quite found a way to give its plunge into the unknown the juice it needs."
Taboo,0,"Not even often-stunning performances... can dig Taboo out of its messy, overwrought darkness."
Fargo,0,"When one character asks a question of another and then announces with a self-regarding smirk that it was rhetorical... Fargo disappears into its own navel, where even the lint is annotated."
WeCrashed,0,I think we could all use a little Jared Leto break.
Rise,0,It's time for a break from the tears. You have to earn those.
Mayor of Kingstown,0,A disappointing bleak drama that doesn't have anything new to say.
The Undoing,0,"A bad man getting away with a bad thing? Lawyers obfuscating the wheels of justice? It's all too familiar. And perhaps this is just 2020 talking, but it's a little exhausting, too."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"The fights lack any excitement, physically or emotionally. There are a couple of fights where it felt like a constant back and forth with a punch, block, repeat."
"Love, Victor",0,"Whether the fantasy ending is due to an early cancellation or the desire to tie everything up with a tidy bow, this final season is unsatisfying. The characters are shadows of themselves, and the interesting messiness (and queer focus) is all but gone"
Invasion,0,"Individually, none of the subplots builds to anything shaped by the careful arcing of a good short story, much less to anything that gives you reason to invest in the main characters."
Dr. Brain,0,"Too often Dr. Brain dodges the dark freakiness of its central idea and instead lingers on rote, slow-moving mystery plotting."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"The Shrink Next Door has plenty of star power but can't get past its confused narrative, disappointing lack of character development, and dragging pace."
Westworld,0,"Viewers who have come this far might not be able to resist sticking around for answers, but these are all teasers the show is posing about itself, from within its own impenetrable lore. Those big questions have shrunk from view."
Hawkeye,0,"If you are very much plugged into the Marvel Universe, yes its a Must Watch. If youre not that bothered, then no."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"The best part about 9 Perfect Strangers is that the Wikipedia entry states up top ""not to be confused with Perfect Strangers."" Oh, how I wish that this were the tale of 9 Balkis..."
Mr. Corman,0,Even the presence of Debra Winger as Josh's mom... and Juno Temple as his ex (a character who feels too ill-defined to really work) feel like wasted opportunities.
"Web of Make Believe: Death, Lies & the Internet",0,While all of the subjects covered in the six episodes sound very interesting a lot of the oomph is taken out of them due to the repetitive and drawn out nature of each.
Star Trek,0,"The actors seem tired, bored in most scenes. Even [William] Shatner, which is saying something."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,It's hard to imagine the viewer who will want to spend much more than the pilot's first hour in Kingstown.
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"It's meant as an episode of reflection, but because previous episodes have given the relationship a flimsy foundation, Scenes still ends on its flattest note."
Hellbound,0,An expendable attempt at a horror series that doesn't stand out. [Full review in Spanish]
The Pentaverate,0,"Had The Pentaverate been made in 1997, it still might not have been much good, but it would have perhaps made more sense. I’ll give it this, mind – it’s nice."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,The problem: Danny Rand is just not compelling enough to carry his own show.
Swagger,0,The diffuse focus makes the series too muddled to really latch on to any one narrative thread.
Dr. Brain,0,"For a show with a wild central premise and a goofily brazen title, nothing here rises to the level of wildness that the show is teasing, nor is there the sort of grounding that could work as an alternative."
The Most Dangerous Animal of All,0,"That's the problem with The Most Dangerous Animal of All: Earl Van Best Jr. never comes into focus, and the Zodiac Killer doesn't either."
Arrested Development,0,"The narrative hand holding and frequent plot reminders built for weekly network TV grew tiresome when watching on the show's adopted home, Netflix."
Bridgerton,0,"Season 1 may have left audiences hot under the collar and begging for more the first time around, unfortunately its successor is more likely to leave viewers yawning, such is the state of affairs with season two."
The O.C.,0,It's easy to deduce how the characters of The O.C. spent their summer vacation. They were practicing jumping the shark. They have it down perfectly.
Taboo,0,"It's an utter slog, and the biggest creative misstep FX has made in a while."
The X-Files,0,"I honestly can't tell whether or not Mulder's dialogue is supposed to sound ridiculous (in the second episode he utters this baffling phrase: ""Scully, you looked so adorbs"")."
The Essex Serpent,0,"Against this beautiful backdrop, the human drama never crackles. Directed by Clio Barnard, the show seems to forget that, along with all the portentous symbolism, there needs to be a spark of wit or a flicker of emotional depth."
Breaking Bad,0,"For five seasons Breaking Bad cooked up some the best drama on television, hands down, but unfortunately, for its final hurrah, we got an unsatisfying batch."
Roar,0,"In its attempts to universalize these intensely personal experiences, Roar loses much of the heart that makes them worth caring about to begin with."
What If...?,0,"Perhaps Marvel's What If...? will be more accessible to non-discerning younger viewers, but for adults, there is not much here to recommend."
Watchmen,0,"Lindelof keeps scribbling in the margins, adding in more and more story that may yet pay off but that takes perhaps undue patience in the interim."
Pieces of Her,0,"Toni Collette is a divine being sent from Heaven with whom we are all fortunate to share time on the same planet. Even Collette, however, cannot redeem what is one of television history’s most worthless characters in Netflix’s Pieces of Her."
24,0,"While the format has been altered a bit... this new season is 12 episodes instead of 24 so some hours will be skipped -- everything else about the show is same-old, same-old."
Waco,0,"The Paramount Network needs something flashy and bold to ring in its launch, and Waco isn't it. The show should have been used as an addition to something bold, not as a starting move."
Killing Eve,0,"Weve grown accustomed to queer characters dying on screen, especially ones in relationships. Keeping these women apart for the majority of the series, giving the characters (and fans) what they want, and then ripping it away is such a tired trope."
Bridgerton,0,"While “Bridgerton” Season 2 arrives with all of the scandal, gossip, and sartorial excellence we’ve become accustomed to, the sophomore outing lacks the fresh appeal and engaging pace of the first season."
24,0,"The Jack-as-wounded-hero archetype had been wrung dry long ago, and Live Another Day does nothing to find new life for it."
Russian Doll,0,"It is an ambitious but ultimately lacking attempt at illustrating how trauma is inherited from one generation to the next, at the expense of the protagonists’ development and season one friendship."
The Alienist,0,"Not a bit of the original's atmospheric quality is lost in the years that have passed between the two seasons... If the goal of Angel of Darkness is to speak to the now and make us think, however, that trail only leads to a dead end."
The Mist,0,"This version tries to have it both ways - goofy and serious - and leaves viewers on the outside looking in, rooting for the mist instead of those running from it."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"Here's the most unforgivable sin of the second season of The Punisher: You have a magnificent performance like this one at your disposal, and this is what you choose to do with it?"
The Thing About Pam,0,"The thing about Pam, sadly, is that despite her crimes, she’s not all that interesting."
Brave New World,0,"Not only have we had a ton of sci-fi dystopias lately, but Huxley's novel is one of the most popular and enduring ever; most of the stuff you're sick of was already cribbed from it in the first place. That puts this new series in a tricky position"
The Man Who Fell to Earth,0,"Why this, and why now?"
The Offer,0,Its goofy failures create a veritable list of guidelines of how not to tell a story when otherwise trying to get across how hard it is to make a movie in Hollywood.
The Man Who Fell to Earth,0,The Man Who Fell to Earth is like the worst kind of tech bro -- it doesn’t offer anything innovative enough to actually live up to its own hype.
Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area,0,"Basically, it reuses everything that gave personality to the [original] Spanish series and presents us with a copy instead of with an adaptation. [Full review in Spanish]"
Prison Break,0,"Fox's revival, alas, begins with a flawed blueprint, while suffering from a been-there, broke-out-of-that quality."
Amazing Stories,0,"Maybe the show will get better; I hope it does. But with so many shows on so many different platforms right now, it seems like Amazing Stories blew its one chance to make a good first impression."
How I Met Your Mother,0,The ultimate takeaway from the final season is that series creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas were at once too good and not good enough to tell the story they ultimately wanted to tell.
The Morning Show,0,"Too often, The Morning Show's second season is satisfied with the easiness of shock -- of announcing itself, though not communicating much of note, in a blare."
Godless,0,"Godless is an almighty letdown. The narrative is as expansive as the vast New Mexico plains that form its backdrop, but there's too much creative tumbleweed."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"This is serious subject matter, but it’s hard not to laugh at some bizarrely surreal flourishes, the howlingly bad dialogue and the preposterously prim accents."
Mr. Corman,0,"The audience doesn't have to like the main character for the show to work, but at the very least, its center of gravity should be more nuanced and compelling than this one."
The Nevers,0,"The world still feels under construction and confused about what its purpose is, something that feels indicative of the lack of a consistent architect throughout."
The Office,0,Will those of us who've gradually fallen away return to see it out? I'm still not sure I will after seeing Thursday's Season 9 premiere
Shadow and Bone,0,The storytelling in this adaptation from showrunner Eric Heisserer (Bird Box. Arrival) fails to establish and maintain a momentum nearly as powerful as some of the show's magic.
Wolverine and the X-Men,0,"Ultimately, the program is reasonably good fun for X-Men aficionados, but the reliance on past movie and comic references... blunts the appeal, as does the occasionally stiff animation quality."
The Mist,0,"Not nearly enough horror, way too much exposition (in the opener). Even the fog seems a little bored hanging around for something to happen."
Normal People,0,The result is hardly incompetent but never bold enough to transcend the standard literary adaptation.
Mr. Corman,0,"Mr. Corman, the new AppleTV+ series from Joseph Gordon-Levitt suffers from a number of issues, not least of which is an uninteresting lead character."
The Undoing,0,"It's all extremely rote, like an expanded version of the mid-budget Nineties movie that would have starred Kidman and Grant at their respective heights of celebrity."
The First Lady,0,"Despite a stacked deck of talented stars and what looks to be sizeable production budget, The First Lady is dead on arrival."
Dr. Brain,0,"It does go some way to fulfilling it prophecy in terms of jump scares, eerie underground car parks and ominous shadows, but is let down by a plot which requires Cliffs Notes."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,The bigger problem is that it’s all just a lot of time-traveling and dealing with the rigors of time-traveling. It’s mono-thematic.
The First Lady,0,The show ultimately plays like a prestige (and repetitive) reenactment of each First Lady's Wikipedia page.
Roar,0,All the starry turns and strong performances can’t make this anthology series cohere into a show that has something to say about contemporary womanhood.
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,"McKay has entered... an Aaron Sorkin-esque level of directorial obtrusiveness, where a filmmaker’s tics and indulgences keep calling attention to themselves, distracting from the narrative at hand rather than amplifying it."
Brave New World,0,The idea of a society where pandemics have been completely eradicated may sound ideal in this particular moment. But that's the only attractive I could find in Brave New World's utopic setting. [Full Review in Spanish]
Killing Eve,0,"From the first time Jodie Comer pressed a knife to Sandra Oh’s throat, the sexy murder drama seemed to promise one thing. Frustrated fans are right to be disappointed."
Inventing Anna,0,"Delvey’s story is riveting. The series, sadly, is not."
The Big Bang Theory,0,"However big a role pop culture may have played in its stories, the show itself could never have served as a barometer for the rest of pop culture. It's impossible to be a meaningful barometer if the dial only ever reads one thing."
The Nevers,0,"When I finished watching, there were no characters I felt drawn to, or provoked by. I took in all the excess and atmosphere, all the flippant banter and brutal fighting, and I was left untouched."
Fargo,0,"Fargo has lost its footing in Season 4, succumbing to stylization and caricature and gratuitous over-plotting, and effectively wasting a tremendous cast. We're left with a weak story and a few banal monologues about race, money, and Life In America."
The Summer I Turned Pretty,0,"The series is striving to capture that feeling of first love, of growing up and finding your own path. There’s moody music, hazy photography, and characters in slow motion. And yet, none of it quite works."
The Wilds,0,"The introduction of the boys is a failed experiment, and unfortunately, apart from a few good moments and an interesting finale, season 2 is a wasted continuation that offers very little."
Invasion,0,"And aside from rhyming with Foundation which premiered last month, Invasion asks a similar question: Do you have time for this?"
11.22.63,0,"11.22.63 reaches some thoughtful, moving conclusions, but oh, what coulda been with a more engaged star. If only there were a time machine to fix that mistake."
The White Lotus,0,"Without a more cohesive story giving it narrative momentum, it often becomes a series of vignettes involving awful, irredeemable people who never make the right choice - and whether that's entertaining or even stomachable really depends on your mileage."
Outer Range,0,Measuring most shows against the masterful Twin Peaks feels unfair. But Brian Watkins’ Outer Range baldly baits the comparison—sometimes with success but more often to his show’s detriment.
The Queen's Gambit,0,"While it is frustrating to see Black characters still reduced to stereotypes in what has been the supposed golden age for Black roles and representation in television, it's not all that surprising."
The Essex Serpent,0,"If you are hoping for Crimson Peak or The Others, this isn’t it either. But, if you are a fan of Jane Eyre or deliberately paced 19th-century British dramas with solid performances, you may enjoy The Essex Serpent. Just don’t say I didn’t warn you."
Limitless,0,"Yet while Limitless is competently executed, what it lacks, finally, is any spark of inspiration. And alas, there's no pill for that."
Lovecraft Country,0,"Lovecraft Country feels like a missed opportunity to repurpose the racist fear at the heart of Lovecraft's work to articulate the specific dread, isolation, and social death felt by Black people in all corners of the world."
Bel-Air,0,It takes every aspect of the original show and sucks out the joy.
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Hulu trotted out Little Fires Everywhere, an eight-part limited series that attempts to capture the sprawling nature of the source material, but ultimately fails."
Big Little Lies,0,Season two's biggest shortcoming is the way it prioritized Mary-Louise at the expense of Bonnie.
The Night Of,0,A show like this one is so busy saying something about the justice system and the prison-industrial complex that it rarely has a moment to consider that one of the injustices here is that a person was killed.
Two and a Half Men,0,"Buddy, your show's been on for 12 seasons. Don't you want to send off your characters in any type of meaningful way? Nah. Let's just use the time to get back at someone for something people have long forgotten about."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"If the series had scaled back some of its theatrics to be more subtle, I think it would've packed a much harder punch. I don't need characters screaming at each other every other scene; I need them to be saying something of interest."
The Big Bang Theory,0,"As The Big Bang Theory enters its final season, and these characters enter new phases of their lives, there are so many possible stories to tell. It just has to stop telling all the same ones."
Man vs. Bee,0,"After a certain point, you stop questioning things and instead enter a fugue state. Is time passing, or are you just stuck in some horrendous ten-minute long Groundhog Day?"
The Offer,0,Too long by half and romanticizes its subject.
Limitless,0,"Maybe the show will improve when it kicks into the case-of-the-week format and ramps up the nonsensical effects of this mysterious pill, but I don't have high hopes."
Defending Jacob,0,"The result is a story that feels both overstuffed and underdeveloped. Like its namesake, Defending Jacob is brought down just as it's taking off."
The Mist,0,Making sense of this mess is probably impossible and not worth the effort.
The Nevers,0,"A mess it is, which is a shame, because of all the too-much going on, a lot of it is a lot of fun."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"If the plotting and the characters in The Mosquito Coast were more compelling, it wouldn't matter as much that Cross has ignored virtually every element of his source material."
Teen Wolf,0,"This finale felt like more of a cliffhanger than anything the show has done before, which is a strange choice when writing the series finale. I don't love knowing that there's a huge war to be fought and that's where all these people are going."
Brave New World,0,"It's not an immediately gripping techno-satire, nor a mindbending puzzle box. It's not an impressive sci-fi world, nor a bold piece of sex-violence-profanity prestige. It's just a disappointing adaptation trying to be everything for everyone."
Unsolved Mysteries,0,Unsolved Mysteries is likely to stay but it has to do better to become a staple series on the streaming service.
The X-Files,0,"As brilliant as Dana Scully was, and as badly as young women needed her, she remained frustratingly beyond the grasp of the men who wrote her."
Taboo,0,"As a showcase for Hardy's considerable acting chops, Taboo is passable, but once you peel away [Tom] Hardy's detailed performance you begin to realize that there's almost nothing to the character he's playing."
Interrogation,0,Perhaps more frustrating is that some of our time in the '80s is given to us free of a person's recollection of events.
Hawkeye,0,Hawkeye feels like it will end up being a quick wiki article scan to get caught up on where everything stands instead of its own standalone story.
Foundation,0,"The dense, at-times muddled narrative offers little to warrant the enthusiasm to justify that, leaving behind an impenetrable show that looks like several million bucks but feels as if it lacks the tools to save itself, much less all mankind."
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"I'm sure there's some thought-through reason that would sound good on the page, but in practice it's a bucket of cold water on a story whose purpose is body-temperature intimacy."
Big Little Lies,0,The flattening of previously full characters may be the biggest loss of this season.
And Just Like That...,0,"The name surely carries plenty of equity, but like the movies, this HBO Max show yields diminishing returns."
A Wilderness of Error,0,"Morris is asking us to consider an unlikely and generally unheralded possibility, and doing so in a manner so insistent as to make the proposition less and less appealing."
Sex and the City,0,"I got to wondering: didn't we reach a climax in our relationship with Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda sooner than any of us would dare to admit?"
Y: The Last Man,0,"While some intriguing & important new elements are added, like Elliot Fletcher's trans character, the show is so concerned with big ideas it neglects all of its characters."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"The series isn't the surprising horror-esque piece it could be, and it doesn't offer a compelling statement on wellness or the people who buy into it. Nothing really happens at all here."
Rome,0,"While the look and feel of the series is still as brilliant as before, it feels wasted on these paltry scripts."
Shining Girls,0,"There’s good stuff here: Alongside Moss, Moura as the journalist aiding her, and Jamie Bell as the personification of human venality pursuing her, do fine work. But there’s simply not enough story here to make for a credible eight-episode series."
Little Voice,0,Little Voice is little short of a horror show.
Lisey's Story,0,"[Director Pablo Larraín] never entirely immerses us in horror or submerge us in grief. It's the opposite, actually. Instead of engrossed, I felt trapped."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"Every time it feels as though the show might actually want to have a real conversation about fate, free will, or consequences, it slides away from the implication without ever fully looking it in the face."
Lisey's Story,0,"Despite Moore's earnest performance, the show gets stuck in a twilight zone between hokey and horrifying. It ultimately comes to resemble a ponderous, misshapen beast, much like the one that haunts Boo'ya Moon."
The Wheel of Time,0,"The action, when it comes, is lively, if predictable, but The Wheel of Time buckles under chunks of tedious exposition."
Brave New World,0,"Sadly, beyond those genre departures that seem like, let's be honest, products of inconsistent tone in the show's writing and direction, Brave New World doesn't offer much."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Despite able performers and potent themes, the show is so addicted to chaos that it squanders its chance to say anything substantive."
Shining Girls,0,[An] intriguing but largely forgettable show.
Entourage,0,It struck me that the show seems even more like escapist candy than it did just a few years ago... Entourage stopped trying to even toy with realism or emotional depth.
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Though the show repeats the same mistakes as Marvel's other Netflix series, those problems are magnified because the show lacks a compelling lead."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,We could've developed Bucky loads more.
Killing Eve,0,"Fourth time around, the sense is of having spent too long on a carnival ride. Nausea is kicking in."
Shadow and Bone,0,"The show's political intrigue comes off as boilerplate, but the thrust of the source material's narrative remains largely unchanged."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"As in Once, the computer-generated landscapes and creatures don't quite work - they look unworldly, but in a cheesy way."
Defending Jacob,0,"Better to leave audiences craving more than demanding less, I suppose, but Defending Jacob boasts a tremendous ensemble of actors who make you wish they had the rich characterizations they deserve."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"It would, at this point, take a truly inspired interpretation to make a Time Traveler’s Wife series work. Sadly, this ain’t it."
Inventing Anna,0,"Inventing Anna transforms a juicy real-life drama about a con artist among the influencer crowd into a fairly inert limited series, in part by giving almost equal weight to the reporter who broke the story."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"If only one of these people would have the decency to drop dead, it would make the show infinitely more engaging."
The Thing About Pam,0,There’s a lot of blurriness of intention around the storytelling in The Thing About Pam and an ultimately complacent belief that Renée Zellweger slurping on soda is enough to count as Emmy bait.
House of Cards,0,This is the worst season of the series despite Robin Wright's best efforts. [Full Review in Spanish]
Behind Her Eyes,0,It opts for a bizarre shock that's baffling at best and deeply tone-deaf at its worst.
Killing Eve,0,I think most will be disappointed at how far from the first two seasons this series has gone and be thankful that they wont be dragging it out much longer.
Pieces of Her,0,"The bad news is that most of the other elements are merely fine, such that there’s no great takeaway for viewers beyond “wow, Toni Collette!” and even that, repeated ad nauseam, becomes a kind of quiet damnation of everything else."
Midnight Mass,0,"Had it been a 90-minute movie, Midnight Mass could pass as innocuous entertainment. But lasting seven hours, this is nothing more than an unfortunate waste of time. [Full Review in Spanish]"
This Is Going to Hurt,0,"It’s akin to watching an episode of “Grey’s Anatomy” or “Chicago Med” or “New Amsterdam” or “The Resident” et al., only spread out over seven episodes instead of a 44-minute storyline."
Godless,0,"If genre cliches are brought into a work to be deconstructed, but said cliches remain stylized and centered, then what's actually being upended in this process?"
House of Cards,0,"The gaping cynicism of these faux Washington insiders also paints a depressing picture of the actual current climate, especially against the backdrop of the real-life controversy in the White House."
13 Reasons Why,0,"Readers may recall how promising this show was at the beginning, when it was simply the adaptation of an acclaimed young adult novel... The final season reclaims only crumbs of that sensibility."
Taboo,0,"Taboo is a grubby, swollen TV gothic that has its moments but, aside from Hardy and some atmosphere, not much else."
Preacher,0,"Preacher Season 4 starts strong, but it can't escape the snare of mediocrity, no matter how much craziness it throws our way. And while the show is rarely subjectively bad, it continues to have issues with tone and characterizations."
Outer Range,0,"By the end of eight frustrating and haphazardly paced episodes, exhaustion sets in."
The Outsider,0,"Curiously -- and annoyingly -- uneven, as if different production crews took over on alternate days undoing one another's work."
Amazing Stories,0,"The upside of any anthology series is the possibility that the next installment can completely turn things around with a brand-new tale. Still, if this is the show's best foot forward, it doesn't imply much optimism."
The Baby,0,"Haphazardly careens from one idea to another, throwing in themes and plot threads that never properly fit together."
Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,0,"""The Lost Symbol"" feels like something you'd watch on Saturday morning cable when the remote is lost, though Peacock might be hoping to secure fans of the ""Librarians"" franchise, too."
Naomi,0,"Moves in slow motion, feeling like a conventional high-school drama with just a pinch of superheroics provided to pull the audience along."
The Thing About Pam,0,The flourishes used on The Thing About Pam were tiring us out by the end of the first episode; we can’t imagine how exhausted we’ll feel after watching the entire six-episode season.
Castle Rock,0,"I can't tell if the new season is over-reaching, under-reaching or if the Annie Wilkes of it all is just overshadowing the story to an unanticipated degree."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"The show depends to a large degree on our knowing that this crazy thing really did happen, kinda sorta in this way. At the same time, with all such adaptations, it is cramped by that dependency..."
Euphoria,0,"It's the prevailing tone, at once nasty and tedious, that I loathe; watching the show, my mood hovers somewhere between boredom and dread."
Undone,0,Nuanced dilemmas quickly fade into the background as the series adopts a more straightforward format in its second season.
Shadow and Bone,0,Shadow and Bone could use some intimacy! Its conflicts as currently written are way too big and too abstract; its characters are too generic and undefined.
Invincible,0,"Invincible has the potential to become a better show, but only if the makers move beyond this adolescent mockery of a superhero series and into a zone of mature storytelling. The ingredients are already there. The mixing needs to be better."
The Fall,0,"Between the spurts of sparse dialogue, dragged-out shots of dimly-lit rooms and corridors (a regrettable legacy of Scandi noir), and long periods of staring into space, there was enough padding here to insulate an attic."
Lisey's Story,0,"Apple's Stephen King Miniseries Starts Off Strong, Only to Quickly Fall Apart."
The Office,0,"Sorry, Dunder Mifflin, I might come back for your going-out-of-business sale (or whatever constitutes a not-so-grand finale), but for now, you're in fourth position in this time period once everything kicks into gear next week."
Mad Men,0,"Gone are the days of ""Zou Bisou Bisou"" and Don's Hawaiian mortality freak-out. Nope. This season premiere, all we got was a cold pastrami sandwich with coleslaw smeared on the bread."
The Wire,0,"Season 5's mistakes-clunky plotting, false parallels, confused motivations-are violations of the realism the show promised."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,0,"Game Changers just shrugs that if the Mighty Ducks' strategy worked for three movies, it'll simply work again here."
Arrested Development,0,"Arrested Development ending, or approaching the finish line, is the best thing for all involved. It's just sad to see everything wrap up on a ""less-than"" note and in a way that, ultimately, doesn't feel much like Arrested Development."
Legion,0,"I responded to moments of Legion because I vibed with its project, but all of the aspects of that project ended up working better in other shows."
Moon Knight,0,Moon Knight barely factors into his own story.
Joe vs Carole,0,"Joe vs. Carole is competently made and entertaining enough but having already sat through the first season of Netflix’s bloated Tiger King, Joe vs. Carole can’t help but feel like a rerun of something I already saw."
The First Lady,0,"The plaiting of the three narratives occurs almost arbitrarily, with the stories converging only in the broadest strokes."
Monsters at Work,0,"As someone who loves the films, I wonder ... do we need more of it? The films are so well self-contained. This feels like an excess of something we don't really need."""
Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,0,There's nothing Ashley Zukerman could have done to make Robert Landgon less of a butthead; his insufferability is a problem with the writing of the show.
And Just Like That...,0,"Nearly a quarter of a century later, And Just Like That affirms that Carrie, Charlotte and Miranda failed to mature into women any sane person would want to spend time with, let alone to grow up to be."
Rise,0,"When Rise shifts focus to one of Robbie's big games, it becomes painfully apparent how effortlessly Friday Night Lights stirred the emotions Rise struggles to find. It's not until the season finale that the show realizes its full tear-jerking potential."
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"The first time it happened, I thought I'd pressed play on a behind-the-scenes special. By the time episode three rolled around, I started shouting 'No!' at the telly."
Midnight Mass,0,"While some of the show's themes are talked to death, others wither away, undeveloped."
Rise,0,"The messages of class disparity, a small town in an economic downturn and the power of a musical never coalesce."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"With the mothership's leads on a similar quest for a missing boy, Wonderland seems like an exercise in magical redundancy. This looking glass is cracked."
Moon Knight,0,"There are many interesting aspects to Moon Knight, but neither the comic books nor this TV show named for him quite know what to do with them all."
The Fall,0,This year's series has been the natural conclusion of the race to the bottom.
The Gilded Age,0,"Sadly, this show, with its cardboard characters, out-of-the-box costumes and obvious movie-set streets is all over the place. And don’t get me started on the bogus CGI architecture."
The Baby,0,"It should be weird and captivating! Instead, The Baby meanders..."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Little Fires Everwhere is not a great series; it's also a pale shadow of the source material. However, it is never boring.The performances are not nuanced, but they are entertaining."
The Stand,0,"As rendered in this iteration of King's epic, that mix of realism and fantasy results in a disjointed, tonally inconsistent work that manages to both over-condense aspects of the original saga and overstay its welcome."
The First,0,The First needs to up its game or it's headed for the black hole of oblivion.
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"This update brings the star power of Jessica Chastain and Oscar Isaac, but can't match the emotional intensity of the original."
Twin Peaks,0,Lynch's twisted brutalization of women likewise continues... It all seems to be part of the director's basic playbook. And it's past time for him to be called out on it.
Outer Range,0,"While the family story and conflicts with the neighboring Tillersons feels overly familiar, credit series creator/writer Brian Watkins with building to shocks at the end of the first two episodes that leave viewers eager to learn what will happen next."
Inventing Anna,0,"It’s an overly long muddle, never quite sure what it wants to say about its title character, or how to say it."
The Endgame,0,"It all looks quite sleek and impressive, but even after just two episodes, Elena’s ability to pull off the impossible out of nowhere begins to get old."
House of Cards,0,Season six is a web with no spider at the centre.
Amazing Stories,0,"The series might all be called Amazing Stories, But Not So Amazing That Heart Patients Can't Watch It."
The First Lady,0,"You will find no objections from me to giving each of these real women a chance to fill a whole series with their dualities, tensions, and complications. But there’s very little of that realness here."
Inventing Anna,0,Ends up feeling like a show-length adaptation of a novelty T-shirt that reads ANNA DELVEY DID NOTHING WRONG in big block letters.
The Gilded Age,0,It comes at you like an undulating wall of plastinated velvet. Watch a single minute of any of this overstyled nine-part period monstrosity about rich American families and you will end up gasping: what is this gopping Edith Wharton-style product?
Sharp Objects,0,"""Sharp Objects"" should leave more of a mark."
The Last Kingdom,0,"Political intrigue and historical authenticity, not to mention decent acting, gave way to romantic slush, [and] unconvincing dialogue which could never make up its mind whether it wanted to be cod-Shakespearean or yoof-friendly."
The Pentaverate,0,'The Pentaverate' is unbelievably bad.
Defending Jacob,0,"This limited series strains for impact. But it's unserious about the aspects of its story that are genuinely potentially interesting, and sillier than one might have any reason to expect."
The White Lotus,0,"Instead of the series' short run delivering a well-honed critique alongside its murder mystery, the end result feels unsatisfyingly unfinished."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,The Time Traveler’s Wife should probably have been left in the past.
The Stand,0,"Boone and Cavell make a series of choices that not only diminish the awesome terror of the first part of King's novel, but the characters themselves, their journeys, and any reason we should care about them."
The OA,0,Annoying. Gripping. But annoying.
Sharp Objects,0,Sharp Objects scratches the surface of being interesting but can't overcome its dull edges.
Big Little Lies,0,"In under an hour, the finale reiterated what most of us were too afraid to admit: The charm of Big Little Lies was in it being a mini-series."
Man vs. Bee,0,"Despite its enticing if predictable premise, Man vs. Bee lacks a sting in its tail."
Lost,0,"The series, which started with so much promise, stalled some time in its third season and will now be remembered as a monstrosity that fused kitsch to camp."
House of Cards,0,"It sounds like a compelling story, but Claire remains an icy, tough-to-read cipher through much of it, despite flashbacks to her childhood and that fourth-wall-breaking, talking-to-the-viewers thing that Spacey once did so well."
Severance,0,"The season finale is genuinely exciting and suspenseful, but, really, even as an advocate of slow television, we might have got there in half the time with twice the effect."
The Undoing,0,"What starts out as a lively drama about scandal among the one percent turns into a turgid thriller and later a courtroom drama, recalling some of the hackier tendencies of past Kelley shows."
Devs,0,"Devs deserves credit for throwing Big Themes up in the AI air and seeing where they land. But, and I'm misquoting the Marx Brothers here, deep down, Devs feels strangely superficial."
The Undoing,0,"This should all be sexily entertaining, and even fun, with Kidman and Hugh Grant playing Grace and Jonathan, and Kelley supplying the banter they exchange around the townhouse kitchen island. And for one episode it is."
The Capture,0,"Offers a whiplash-inducing premiere that goes from, ""This is a ridiculous investigation that appears to lack a crime"" to ""How is that possible?""... A somewhat dubious premise."
The Shrink Next Door,0,Herein lies the central problem with The Shrink Next Door. It's not interesting to watch someone avoid conflict.
Suspicion,0,"Aside from a finale that feels notable only for its sloppiness, this thriller is about as forgettable as they come."
Arrested Development,0,"The more you know about what's happened with Tambor over the past 12 months and the cast's attempt to reframe it, the emptier the comedy's absurdist spectacle becomes."
The Shrink Next Door,0,Mainly what held my interest in The Shrink Next Door was the myriad reasons it doesn't quite work.
Girls,0,It's unlikely anything will be fully formed - characters or tone - by the end of the final episode. Girls will stay frustrating.
Killing Eve,0,"Ever since the series’ first season, Killing Eve has been stuck in a weird holding pattern when it comes to these characters... And in the final season, don’t we -- and these characters -- deserve more?"
The Stranger,0,"In lieu of a single, compelling premise, its mystery is a web of disparate threads, which not only makes it plot-heavy but prevents any real character development."
Marvel's Hero Project,0,"The real-world stories are inspiring enough. The framing device, in which the word ""Marvel"" is pronounced as often as is (slightly more than) seemly, is a distraction that feels like self-promotion."
The Nevers,0,"There's nothing wrong with wanting The Nevers to be a unique vision, and disappointing to realize it gives us very little we haven't seen before."
The Outsider,0,"The stakes here seem to be massive; gradually, it becomes clear that an epidemic of darkness is overtaking many. But getting there, with so little in the way of character or freshness of tone, simply exhausts even an interested viewer."
Suspicion,0,"Suspicion raises too many doubts, and fails to resolve any of them."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,0,"There will surely be some watchable gags... but between the consistently uncertain run and a world that has seen such a substantial shift in mindset, it's safe to say that viewers are more than ready to say goodbye."
A Teacher,0,"While it's visually handsome, with performances from the two leads that are equally staggering, the show fails to accomplish what it wants to do in the first place."
Foundation,0,The individual parts of this Foundation equation add up to something that's very pretty and slightly dull. Asimov's books have long been considered impossible to adapt. This version is a noble effort that can't quite solve the problem.
Twin Peaks,0,"""I am dead. Yet I live,"" [Laura Palmer] said. Much the same could be said of the revival, which resembles a danse macabre, full of familiar steps, but with some new missteps all of its own."
Prison Break,0,"There's a reason the phrase ""You can't go home again"" amounts to a cliché. You really can't. Especially when home is a prison."
X-Men,0,"Winding down, this series just wasn't as entertaining at the end as it was in the first few seasons"
God's Favorite Idiot,0,"One of the worst shows of the year... Everything about this series is jaw-droppingly slack and unambitious, given the talent involved."
The Essex Serpent,0,Some viewers are sure to enjoy its generally slow pacing — and all that breathing the story is allowed to do — but others may find their attention drifting more than once.
Night Sky,0,"Flat material that wants to mix the surreal nature of sci-fi with the humble humdrum of eating at a breakfast diner, but hardly feels more urgent or clever than that."
Guilty Party,0,"Everything that Beth does in this clumsy, unfunny show makes her seem more like someone who's never even taken a journalism class, let alone won a prestigious industry award."
Invasion,0,"It's sophisticated, visually excellent, but doesn't quite hit the mark. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Interrogation,0,We have no confidence that this mix-and-match episode format is anything more than a gimmick and will just lead to confused viewers.
Halo,0,"The goal shouldn’t be about being everything to everyone, and while “Halo” treats the source material with respect, it does so with a tentativeness, as if it is afraid to miss a key element."
House of Cards,0,"House of Cards never quite maintains momentum, again; the first five episodes sent to critics are sometimes promising, sometimes plodding."
Inventing Anna,0,"Rhimes isn't shy about availing herself of artistic license. In this story, however, she forgoes fleshing out her characters and bloats each episode's runtime instead."
WandaVision,0,"As an exercise in cloning, it's all morbidly fascinating: The re-creations of the various classic shows and their styles display both a knowledge of and deep affection for old-time TV... But what was tedious then is tedious now."
Joe vs Carole,0,"Joe vs. Carole, despite some decent performances and effective directing from Justin Tipping, rarely justifies its existence."
House of Cards,0,"Plans, schemes, endgames -- who has any use for those? The crazier Washington became, the more House of Cards lost its touch."
The Endgame,0,It's laughable rather than intimidating.
Devs,0,A product that delivers neither the wildly creative sense of tech's possibilities nor the ground-level excavation of his characters... Devs is a misfire for a talented creator.
Ginny & Georgia,0,"If the writers trimmed away one or two, the mother-daughter tension at its core could shine. But with so much going on, that dynamic gets lost."
Shadow and Bone,0,"There are shows that flow cohesively and others that feel like several scenes meshed together, and 'Shadow and Bone' has many lost in the mesh."
The Alienist,0,"The dialogue is stodgy and the mystery nowhere near as gripping as TV's other show about a mom falsely accused of her child's murder, Perry Mason. But it's just good enough, and you can't beat the period atmosphere."
What If...?,0,"For a series set in the infinite vastness of a multiverse, What If...? is dreaming awfully small."
Sharp Objects,0,"There is much to recommend Sharp Objects: its visual language is rich and fugal (blades, pigs, fans recur) and rewards close watching. But the dissatisfaction of the show's conclusion speaks to a larger confusion in the aim of the series."
The Offer,0,"What unremarkably ensues is a kind of broad and tacky Godfather cosplay with zero subtext, nothing to say and very little to aspire to other than telling an increasingly self-satisfied tale of how The Godfather was made."
The Morning Show,0,"You've got to appreciate the moxie of a high-profile streaming series where a character blurts, ""Another streaming service? It should be illegal."" That's The Morning Show's second season in a nutshell: having its cake while choking on it."
The Gilded Age,0,The fact that Julian Fellowes has a done a lot of research for this will be appreciated by a lot of people and especially for those who love his stuff. For others they may find it a yawn-festlike I did.
Behind Her Eyes,0,Behind Her Eyes is just too ridiculous to take even half as seriously as the show takes itself.
The Wheel of Time,0,"How did Pike manage to keep up that sense of terrified, intense urgency, with all those boring plastic animals horsing around her? Where was all the swearing and off-colour shagging?"
The Act,0,Watching the series becomes a bit of a slog where you are just waiting for the crime to happen so that the narrative can move forward.
Mr. Corman,0,Spending five-plus hours watching a very average man inch toward slightly greater self-awareness doesn't make for the most powerful TV experience.
Waco,0,Violent docudrama has unsettling depiction of cult leader.
Mare of Easttown,0,"More than halfway through the series, there's barely any momentum to the mystery, and the relationship drama is sprawling and unfocused."
Chernobyl,0,Mazin name-checks most of the pertinent facts of the story. But his cheap theatrics... detract from the real tragedy of the story.
The Haunting of Hill House,0,This Haunting is so far from the original source material that it's more of a demolition than adaptation.
The Crown,0,"Duty may be life and pain for the royal family. But in The Crown, it's also ultimately spiritless."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"Somewhere in here is a layered examination of the way people orient themselves around another that prods at how power fits into romantic relationships, but that story was too hard to tell/"
A Teacher,0,t's a shame because those scenes show that the series is capable of good visual storytelling. So it just makes the whole experience worse when you realize the missed potential.
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"The tone wanders, mixing scenes in ominously idyllic locations with supposedly meaningful closeups of fruit being whipped into submission for smoothies."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"It's a top-notch cast, and the collective strengths of the actors make the series sing when the rest is flimsy. But the mystery at the heart of it all... isn't always effective, more an afterthought rather than a prevalent riddle."
Under the Dome,0,"The torturous double-feature of ""Move On"" and ""But I'm Not"" may as well have been in Swahili or Dome-anese because I haven't the foggiest about what actually happened in it. Are we even sure they showed the right episode?"
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"Thinking ruins it in a very specific ways. Kick the mental tires too much on this genre romance, and the whole thing slides right into Skeeveyville."
Ozark,0,"Yes, I watched the second half of the Netflix hit series’ final season, and no, it wasn’t good. And I say this as someone who used to like the show."
What If...?,0,"What If...? opens up a world of possibility for Marvel, which it explores with enthusiasm, but also, in an act of hubris, with one hand tied smirkingly behind its back."
Foundation,0,"Foundation isn't based on the books, it's inspired by them. In other words, Foundation merely serves as a - excuse me - foundation for the TV show. I just wish its foundation, the first season, had a better idea of what it wanted to be."
The Wheel of Time,0,What frustrates me is from the outset of The Wheel of Time is that it does that thing where it spends five minutes quickly explaining a world you dont know with terminology you have never heard or really understand.
Bodyguard,0,"After a few chapters, Bodyguard does something that is as bold as it is absurd, changing all the pieces of the game, but losing all cohesion. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Shrink Next Door,0,"""Something something daddy issues"" is a perilously slender thread from which to hang an entire scripted drama, and perhaps that's why the show feels so sterile."
Fargo,0,"Fargo has always been a little off-kilter, but those elements stand out as particularly indulgent or egregious this season, when its overall storytelling approach is so uneven."
Good Sam,0,An over-emotive hospital soap opera that's even more slavishly bound by the conventions of its genre.
The Book of Boba Fett,0,"The episodes had little to offer. And when they ran out of Fett's past and present, The Book of Boba Fett simply ditched him and switched over to Din Djarin."
Treadstone,0,Kring still hasn't figured out that momentum isn't the same thing as complexity...
WandaVision,0,"While it's far too early to assess the nine-episode, $150 million gamble fully, so far it's interestingly bad."
The Nevers,0,"The Nevers is a huge mess, which has both far too much going on yet is also crushingly stupefying. The only bright points were Donnelly and Skelly, who shared an irascible chemistry."
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,"Luke Cage might be bulletproof, but the character's eponymous Netflix series looks weaker in Season 2 -- not bad, overall, but still experiencing the equivalent of a sophomore slump."
Normal People,0,"The beauty of the novel is that so much between its protagonists is left unsaid, but perhaps it might have been better if the BBC had left the literary version of Normal People to speak for itself."
The Afterparty,0,"The Afterparty squanders the talents of its cast with a broad, derivative and annoyingly obnoxious screenplay."
Killing Eve,0,This one’s over. It’s done.
Stay Close,0,"The trouble with Stay Close is that it's too familiar. Despite the plethora of unexpected twists, this series manages to feel identical to every other crime drama that's been thrown out in recent years, and not a particularly great one at that."
The Beatles: Get Back,0,"Clearly in an act of self-parody, Jackson has transformed what was initially supposed to be a two-hour film into a three-part series that is nearly four times longer than originally intended."
The Crown,0,"The Crown has firmly placed itself as yet another vehicle of Britain's colonial amnesia, blissfully neglectful of the collective traumas of postcolonial nations."
Mare of Easttown,0,"Winslet elevates everything, but ""Mare of Easttown"" needs some serious elevating out of its dreariness and familiarity. It's certainly watchable but also predictable. Look elsewhere for light."
The Night Of,0,"This drawn-out, plodding miniseries stretches every one of its meager strengths beyond its breaking point."
The Thing About Pam,0,"While providing superficial nods to Pam’s grievances, The Thing About Pam repeatedly recedes into a one-note character study, a regression only emphasized by Renée Zellweger’s exaggerated lead performance."
The Sopranos,0,One can understand David Chase's desire to have a completely unique ending... But that doesn't mean we have to like it.
Limitless,0,"Limitless may give you an immediate high, but side effects may include listlessness, dangerous plot holes and a sinking feeling you've wasted an hour of your life."
The Essex Serpent,0,"Despite its riveting source material, The Essex Serpent ends up being a gothic bore. Even the charms of Tom Hiddleston can't save this one."
True Blood,0,People can debate when True Blood's creative rigor mortis officially set in but suffice it to say this once-significant and hugely lucrative HBO series limps into its seventh and final season looking pretty anemic.
Moon Knight,0,Moon Knight attempts to do something even more different in the MCU but it fails at every attempt.
Jericho,0,"On paper, the idea of building a new democracy from the ruins of war while government contractors run amok is just as strong as the original premise of Jericho. But the execution remains mediocre."
Our Flag Means Death,0,Our Flag Means Death proves to be too droll for its own good.
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"May get better on the long run but the ""Big Sky"" twist at the start does not bode well."
Dr. Death,0,"Duntsch never adds up to a character we can understand, and standing back and wondering just how far beyond our understanding some people can be doesn't fly as the takeaway for eight hours' worth of entertainment."
Bridgerton,0,Season 2 timidly skimmed the surface of such representation when I needed it to leap into sumptuous storytelling. I couldn’t escape into it while I was also trying to navigate its unsatisfying approach to inclusivity.
The Mosquito Coast,0,"[W]hat THE MOSQUITE COAST largely offers is an uninteresting family survival drama, with different villains introduced in each episode strictly for a reason to make the journey more gripping but add nothing meaningful."
Interrogation,0,"Interrogation is just good enough to be frustrating for the ways in which it isn't yet better, and most of them stem back to the original sin of the show's format."
Y: The Last Man,0,"Unfortunately, this series doesn't do enough to modernize questions from the original text."
Sex/Life,0,"There is a lot of sex and a lot of nudity in Sex/Life and while Netflix probably had hoped that Sarah Shahi's presence would elevate the series, the shoddy directing and the bad writing from Stacy Rukeyser mostly drags Shahi down with it."
Stranger Things,0,Season 4 was a 13-hour-plus behemoth that added Wes Craven to its mood board but otherwise ended with undeveloped characters and obvious but superficial allusions to contemporary crises.
Under the Dome,0,There's a difference between a storyline and just writing a load of nonsense. Vote with your remote.
True Blood,0,"I won't go so far as to say that True Blood's limping into its final season, but it's definitely anemic."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"There is something algorithmic, machine-made about the series, as if all involved were assembled by a computer trying to simulate buzz-worthy television. Come to think of it, that might make a more interesting series."
Loot,0,"It’s only thanks to Rudolph’s ability to balance winsomeness, befuddlement, and sincerity that Molly isn’t utterly infuriating, and even with that in mind, Loot overestimates how much of the character viewers will be willing to tolerate."
Game of Thrones,0,"[This season] made choices that I just didn't understand...you have to wrap it up somehow, and this season is just full of more extremes and it just doesn't work anymore or fit in with the rest..."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"Overall The Time Travelers Wife is funny and poignant in its best moments, but uncomfortable and cringe-worthy at its worst."
Star Trek,0,"It's just an unlikely space opera, overlong, clunkily put together and not the slightest bit amusing."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,Its timely racially and politically charged plot lacks focus.
The Nevers,0,Kingsley Amis one complained that his son Martin's determinedly dazzling prose left him feeling 'bombarded by felicities'. The Nevers has a similar effect -- except that the would-be felicities are far less felicitous.
The Morning Show,0,"""The Morning Show"" has become such a media object of fascination, I think, not just because the odds were so heavily stacked in its favor, but because it ultimately squanders so much of its potential."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"[It] spends a great deal of time drip feeding epiphanies, dwelling in personal moments and dealing in character and yet there is a disconnect. Production design, cinematography and score all come together with direction and tone yet something is missing"
Inventing Anna,0,"Like Delvey herself, “Inventing Anna” is all flash with little substance — offering little insight into this enigmatic figure."
Losing Alice,0,"As a psychological drama, Losing Alice feels too self-conscious to be enjoyable or even provocative. Its inherent eroticism feels ill-earned only because Avin seems to be prone to sanitising the brazen fixations of his protagonists."
Amazing Stories,0,Those tuning in expecting to see the director's light touch and clever manner of engaging our emotions will be disappointed: The show's first installment feels less like a revival than a holdover.
Boardwalk Empire,0,"Despite the show's relative longevity, this final season still feels like a perfunctory jump to the end, as if Winter expected Boardwalk Empire to last as long as Prohibition itself."
The Most Dangerous Animal of All,0,"There's a lot to like in the second half of the season, but the buy-in requires you to move through some weaker material."
Foundation,0,"As a new sci-fi show, it would be fine. As a big-budget, flagship production for Apple it looks like a fine opportunity wasted."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"The storylines are byzantine, but they are not complicated. There is also no shortage of weary, heavy-handed platitudes, like fortune cookies that exclusively quote Bob Segar songs."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"The creative choice to provide little to no backstory severely dulls the show's impact. The Mosquito Coast remains just a surface-level, sepia-toned thriller about a family on the run, mostly to coax the vanity of its patriarch."
Forever,0,"It's like a mild-mannered reporter with a secret identity, but the secret identity is a mild-mannered marketing guy. The show sounds mysterious and alluring, until you know what it's hiding."
Night Sky,0,Watch the first episode of Night Sky and you’ll have found your new favourite show. Carry on for another seven and you’ll wish you stopped a lot earlier.
Truth Be Told,0,"Unfortunately, Truth Be Told 2 does not grip at the get-go."
Joe vs Carole,0,"It’s not that the series isn’t good, though it really isn’t. It’s that with the abundant oversaturation of Tiger King having come and gone, what more can be done?"
First Kill,0,"The story is one you’ve definitely heard before, the leads lack chemistry, and the whole thing is lit like a deodorant commercial."
24,0,"24 is still fast-paced for the most part, although a little slow off the mark in its first hour. And the 47-year-old Sutherland remains trim and limber as an aging Jack of few words, most of them downers."
Invincible,0,"Once the initial face-punch of that first episode wears off, there's not enough powering (or superpowering) ""Invincible."""
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"[It] doesn't seem able to trust Witherspoon to convince viewers to appreciate or like Elena on her own strengths, even though watching [her] paste a sunny smile over a casually terrible statement is the deepest and purest pleasure [It] has to offer."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,0,"However, season seven took this farther than it had to, losing the series' signature comedy and making it feel more like a chore to watch week to week than anything else."
Moon Knight,0,This hodgepodge of underdeveloped themes is augmented by run-of-the-mill action sequences that not only lack invention but also emotional thrust. Mohamed Diab’s first foray into Hollywood is a giant folly with a lot of promise and too little reward.
13 Reasons Why,0,"Season 4 is a disaster that betrays 13 Reasons Why's characters, its only remaining asset. The show has squandered any goodwill left over by its once-charming cast."
Joe vs Carole,0,"Later in the season, Joe yells, “Nobody watches ‘Duck Dynasty’ for the ducks!” This show is all ducks."
Catastrophe,0,Co-creators Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney still inhabit their roles with almost frightening conviction. But I do feel that enough will be enough in a few weeks' time.
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"If you enjoyed season 1 you'll be perfectly happy with this addition, but it doesn't do anything interesting with a character who should feel more relevant to our current political climate."
Dr. Death,0,"Despite the show's few thrills, its structure only reveals an unsteady grasp of the story at its center."
Invasion,0,"Rather than so much as utter the word ""alien"" in these initial episodes, Invasion focuses on the global ripple effects of increasing panic -- which might be fine, if it also did a decent job developing its many characters along the way."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"Maybe a different creative team could've done a better job adapting The Shrink Next Door, or maybe Marty Markowitz's story simply didn't need to be retold."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Maybe it'll tie together in the final two episodes and reach a dramatically satisfying conclusion with a few nifty turns and twists down the stretch. So far, though, this is a perfectly mediocre affair."
The Nevers,0,There are a lot of other shows more worthy of investing your time in.
Snowflake Mountain,0,"In this instance, hate the show, not the contestants, and what we learn is that just when you think Netflix won’t go lower, it certainly will."
Dave,0,"Dave is still a biting satire set within the music industry that depicts the many pitfalls of making it to the main stage at Coachella. But especially this season, it's sometimes difficult to watch."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,0,"As with most ventures like this, the total assembly is a very mixed bag of quality, dipping on the negative side of the ledger here overall."
A Teacher,0,Lots of people have bad childhoods and boring spouses yet never end up becoming sexual predators. Where's the limited series about those people?
Chernobyl,0,"At its best, the show emphasizes the layered venality of careerist buck-passing and the hopeful denialism of those who will refuse to think the unthinkable; at its worst, it suggests that these are specifically Soviet characteristics. They are not."
Foundation,0,"As with some of Apple's other high budget series, the desire to look massive overtakes a lean narrative... This is probably the priciest slow burner show ever made."
Waco,0,More notable for its casting than its execution.
Shining Girls,0,There was simply not enough here to fill all that screen time. “Shining Girls” would have been better as a 105-minute movie.
Losing Alice,0,Director and writer Sigal Avin so belabors the point that an idle mind can stray into self-destruction that Losing Alice paradoxically has the same effect on its viewers.
The Mist,0,The Mist unfolds as though we'll be surprised to learn that humans are capable of cruelty.
Star Trek: Picard,0,"Season 2 immediately reverses track. Star Trek: Picard gives in to audience expectation, maybe even pressure, to try and tap not just a 1990s but also 1980s nostalgia for the franchise. It largely fails at both."
The Undoing,0,"The Undoing has an intriguing mystery at its core, and a wonderful ensemble, but questionable structural choices give the series an odd ""stop and go"" feeling, padding it out to its lengthy runtime of 332 minutes."
All of Us Are Dead,0,"The series ultimately bites off more than it can chew in themes, characters, and ambition."
Black Mirror,0,'Black Mirror' has lost its spark as season five leans on findings of the past. [Full Review in Spanish]
Suspicion,0,There’s not enough substance or character development here to hold our attention beyond the time it takes to click “NEXT.”
Night Sky,0,"Sissy Spacek and J.K. Simmons are powerhouses here, delivering poignant performances, and even carrying the weight when the show spirals into numbing nonsense."
The Essex Serpent,0,"A decent production budget and starry cast led by Tom Hiddleston and Claire Danes are squandered on a dreary, convoluted, portentous drama with all the appeal of a fog blanket over a giant rotting fish which someone briefly mistook for a dead dragon."
Devs,0,"Garland's vision is in the forefront here, and the result is a limited series with a frosty emotional tone, and a story heavy on cutting-edge techno-speak, but skimpy when it comes to characterization."
The Wheel of Time,0,"Based on the six episodes available for review, The Wheel of Time doesn't seem inherently unfilmable. It simply could have been filmed better."
The Offer,0,"This Seventies flashback tries to hit a lot of marks at once... The only way it genuinely works, however, is as a parody of prestige TV."
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,0,"The show's attempt to individualize its protagonists largely reduces them to predictable, banal archetypes."
Queer as Folk,0,"A ripped-from-the-headlines premise may locate the new series in the white-hot center of modernity, but Dunn and company extract little insight from that aggressive timeliness."
The Capture,0,"It's gripping up to a point, but really it's just you staring at a screen while watching another person staring at a screen."
The Nevers,0,There is a lot going on in The Nevers. The only thing it seems to lack is a point.
Archive 81,0,"Netflix's new horror show Archive 81 offers promising scares and intrigue across the board, but in its execution, it forgets the most important thing: the characters."
Turner & Hooch,0,"Unfortunately, at least in these first three episodes, the show is too caught up in recreating the squabbles between Turner and Hooch over and over again in new scenarios."
Community,0,"The last season of Community was really, truly awful. I mean, it crashed and burned. And for a show as self-aware as this one, there's no way it didn't know it."
Mare of Easttown,0,"Gone are the days when HBO would produce only outright classics targeted at discerning audiences - in the streaming age, a wider clientele must be catered to."
The Affair,0,The Affair Season 5 Episode 1 was a colossal waste of time.
Sweet Tooth,0,"The show turns Jeff Lemire's lurid comic into a childlike adventure, but it loses the complexity, the ugliness, and the raw emotion that made the saga so rich in the first place."
The Thing About Pam,0,This series is a frustrating and surprisingly boring attempt to cash in on the true crime boom.
Lisey's Story,0,"The back half of this miniseries is so bogged down by inconsistent pacing, drawn-out scenes, muddled plotting, and a frustratingly anticlimactic ending that all the good Lisey's Story delivers before that collapse ends up overshadowed."
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,0,"The show feels like more Star Wars: Clone Wars, and yet never reaches the heights that it's sister series did, and ultimately doesn't find it's own voice as a result."
The Nevers,0,"""The Nevers'"" inconsistencies can make for a maddening viewing experience - sending you from the edge of your seat to sprawled out on the floor, trying to find your eyes after they rolled out of your head... But I'd be lying if I said I'm done."
House of Cards,0,"It isn't easy to replace Frank Underwood, who... has become one of the most legendary characters ever portrayed on a TV show. However, it is obvious that this season not only lacked inspiration - it was lacking, in general."
Boardwalk Empire,0,"These great clunking scenes are not only dull and unnecessary, they also draw unwanted attention to Boardwalk's greatest weakness. Empathy can't be retconned. It has to be earned."
Loki,0,"Loki feels too constrained, too stale, for a story about a wayward god of mischief. Too much exposition bogs down the script."
Weeds,0,It felt like the Weeds finale could have been more focused and a bit more eventful.
Arrested Development,0,"You could forgive all this if these episodes were funny, if they contained even a trace of the spark that made its first run so incredible. But they aren't. They're flat and lifeless and pointless."
Lisey's Story,0,"Lisey's Story is pretty to look at and fairly faithful, but far too bloated to be very engaging."
Pieces of Her,0,It just could have been so much better.
Sex/Life,0,"All of this would be laudable if the writing weren't hilariously atrocious. At least it's adhering to form, which means you can fast forward through most of it."
Hawkeye,0,"""Hawkeye"" is clearly more concerned with setting up Kate Bishop for future MCU phases than creating a problem worthy of two heroes' time. And at six hours, it's certainly not worthy of yours."
Arrested Development,0,"It's never a waste to follow the stories of these characters, but the experience is becoming increasingly hollow."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,This could have been eight episodes.
The Outsider,0,"Price, an excellent screenwriter and novelist in his own right, played down The Outsider's supernatural elements so much, it was almost as if he was ashamed to embrace horror, in case it dented the miniseries' prestige TV aspirations."
The White Lotus,0,"The creator, director and scriptwriter of the series, Mike White... abandoned any kind of subtlety to establish a clear position. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Office,0,"It succumbed to the bane of American TV -- the endless more-more-more of anything good or popular, the twisting of characters into pretzels to simply keep them in motion, the cheap substitutes after lead actors depart."
11.22.63,0,"I'm still not entirely convinced about 11.22.63 just yet. While I have always enjoyed Franco as an actor, I'm not getting the sense of conviction that I got from book-Jake."
Hawkeye,0,"Even a show that approaches its episodic run like an extra-long movie owes the audience a bit more momentum than this, especially when those installments roll out weekly."
The Essex Serpent,0,"Restrained as a corset, it feels as if The Essex Serpent doesn't want us to excite ourselves or to get any ideas beyond the ones drolly lined out for us. And that's a shame."
The Boys,0,The series’ ideology feels increasingly hollow.
Y: The Last Man,0,Y: The Last Man is perfectly serviceable sci-fi fare that won't move the needle too much in either direction in terms of generating controversy or inspiring awe. And that's a shame... That it settles for dull and uninspired breaks my heart.
WeCrashed,0,"Its strong start meanders to [a] repetitive, inevitable end."
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,0,"The Bad Batch is good to dip into, but it can make for a bad binge."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"""Marvel's Jessica Jones"" gets off on the wrong foot in Season 3 and stays there until the lackluster end."
Girls,0,"For a show that started off so real to its target demographic, it didn't end that way."
The Offer,0,Am offer you can refuse.
Inventing Anna,0,"Despite its more evocative performances, Inventing Anna demands patience that doesn’t pay off, squandering its promising potential along the way."
Inventing Anna,0,"Inventing Anna’s chronic inability to get to the point is reflected in its sprawling nine-episode length, each one lasting an hour or more, not least because the show keeps recycling its own flashbacks as if poking us to stay awake."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,Mostly Renner just acts tired and frustrated. The feeling is contagious.
The Problem With Jon Stewart,0,"Carrying those extra 15 minutes, ""The Problem"" drags; its monologues need honing, its jokes, if they stick around, need punching up, and its segments need to be trimmed down to the essence."
Moon Knight,0,A series that ultimately feels rushed.
Bel-Air,0,"Bel-Air is a glossy, expensive-looking soap that, like Fox’s Our Kind of People, puts the spotlight on uber-wealthy Black families. But “fresh?” Not so much."
Friends,0,"The ""Friends"" soap opera ended predictably and blandly last night, with no big surprises, just two little ones -- Monica's and Chandler's twins."
The First Lady,0,"Ten episodes in, you don’t come away feeling you know the stories of these women any better, any deeper, than you already did."
Arrested Development,0,It's hard to argue that the show's maintained the sly political relevance that elevated it during its initial run.
Stranger Things,0,This volume of the Stranger Things saga could use some of the humor and warmth that made the show such a clever blend of nostalgia and fantasy.
Euphoria,0,"Euphoria is unrelentingly explicit this time around, as if it took one look at its former self and thought: no, not shocking enough, try this."
Big Little Lies,0,"The new episodes flirted with exploring the effects of trauma, but the writers shrugged when it came to finding a deeper meaning to suffering than that it simply sucks."
Arrested Development,0,"Unfortunately for the show, even without the controversies putting a cloud over proceedings, the simple fact of the matter is that this season just isn't that good."
House of Cards,0,"Robin Wright is many things, but possessed of a light touch she is not."
Little America,0,"Little America is muddled, with its baked-in politics directly in opposition to its ""positive"" message."
Altered Carbon,0,"I found myself desperately wishing for Altered Carbon to leave its world of endless lives, satellite back ups, and shapeless political revolutions behind, to focus... on the AIs discarded by humanity as yet another resource to be wasted and forgotten."
The Wheel of Time,0,"With a deficit of whimsy and wonder, ""Wheel"" introduces such thinly developed characters that it makes it hard to care (or see) who survives a chaotically filmed attack by monstrous orcs (sorry, trollocs)."
Defending Jacob,0,Perhaps the biggest crime committed in Defending Jacob is that the elements to make this series pop are all there; they just weren't executed properly.
The Wheel of Time,0,"You are... left with the uneasy, then sinking, feeling that ""Wheel"" - as sumptuous a production as this is - has been done before and better. A couple of times, at least."
The Beatles: Get Back,0,The Beatles: Get Back documentary proves once again that Peter Jackson's meticulous approach to filmmaking is impressive but excessive.
The Undoing,0,"The Undoing has undeniably high production values and a top-notch cast, but they're in service of increasingly lackluster and inconsistent storytelling."
Roar,0,"The problem of Roar might just be the curse of inconsistency that always follows around anthologies. But this feels like something more serious than a case of variable quality, and instead something more existential for the show itself. On"
Modern Family,0,"Overall, though, it felt a bit dutiful. As though the cast, much like the characters, knew that it had become a bit too claustrophobic, but still weren't wholly sure they had the guts to go."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,The main storyline isn't strong enough and the incongruous peripheral elements just confuse rather than engage the viewer.
Stranger Things,0,Season 4 feels like it’s been designed to produce good data rather than quality entertainment.
Raised by Wolves,0,Raised by Wolves wafts into emotional and narrative oblivion.
Pieces of Her,0,"A tedious, tiresome mess that almost put me to sleep."
WandaVision,0,"Based on the first three episodes, 'Wanda Vision' does not deliver the unique entertainment one might expect. However there are indications there may be a brighter future."
Our Flag Means Death,0,"While in some ways, Bonnet is a role [Darby] was born to play, with plenty of opportunities for flailing both verbally and visually, many audience members may find he quickly grates."
Midnight Mass,0,"Midnight Mass only really gets going in episode three. And, when it finally sets off, it doesn't seem to know where it is heading."
Joe vs Carole,0,"It's called Joe vs. Carole, but it should have been called Dumb vs Dumber."
The Undoing,0,"The issue isn't that The Undoing tries to channel Big Little Lies, but that it does so unsuccessfully. Even in its failures, however, The Undoing made me dream of a world where TV could crack the code..."
WeCrashed,0,"In declining to conjecture what WeWork’s nosedive meant for the rest of us, it’s got even less of a purpose than a co-working space during a pandemic."
The Pentaverate,0,"If you're not bowled over by the eight rubbery faces Myers cycle through its six episodes, maybe it's because they're only slightly removed from versions of his characters you've laughed with before but whose humor feels crustily outdated in 2022."
Inventing Anna,0,"On screen, the story is neither salacious enough nor studied enough to bring about any concrete conclusions. Instead, it falls into its own obsessive rabbit hole, and we dont feel inclined to follow."
Arrested Development,0,"Coming across more like a tribute band to the series itself and ditching the controversial experimentation of 2013's Season 4, this second season of the comedy... is simply less original for a show that used to spark with cleverness."
Stranger Things,0,Stranger Things is still Stranger Things. It just now comes with astoundingly thick levels of padding.
The Mist,0,There's room for interesting rehashes that bring new perspectives and ideas. The Mist is definitely not one of them.One adaptation was enough.
Behind Her Eyes,0,Your time would be better spent reading a book. Just not the book this train wreck of a drama this based on.
Moon Knight,0,"Moon Knight is a snooze fest. Most of it is about MacGuffins ... and as the hero and villain chase, find, and procure them, the new Marvel series becomes too plot driven. (This also results in obvious and unnecessary exposition.)"
Doctor Who,0,"It's not that ambition is bad, but Legend of the Sea Devils is ambitious in all the wrong ways -- the unachievable ones."
One of Us Is Lying,0,"The conclusion will be a surprise, one assumes. But the getting there is, as they might say in French class, déjà vu."
Prison Break,0,The nostalgia works against the show.
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Elena is thinly drawn as an obviously villainous ""white savior"" and Witherspoon is repeating her performance from Big Little Lies with less nuance and shading."
Two and a Half Men,0,"Two and Half Men hit a new low every season and then continued to sink even further underground. During this last season, the show went off the rails in terms of absurdity and offensiveness."
Godless,0,"The show is filled with unnecessary rapes, voyeuristic violence against women, and frivolous female nudity."
Lisey's Story,0,"This is intense, dark and disturbing material that could have woven the thread more adeptly through the needle. Sometimes we worry about Stephen King."
Fringe,0,"At some point, Fringe kind of fell in love with change for its own sake, and it wandered away for long periods from what powered its finest moments - the complex bonds among Olivia, Peter and Walter."
Moon Knight,0,A six-hour series that would have worked better as a two-and-a-half-hour film.
Godless,0,"It shows, in a bad way, that the original material was designed for a short film format, and you can tell that there was no script to fill the more than seven hours that the miniseries lasts. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"It's a TKO, right? Well, perhaps on paper. In execution, the limited series based on Moriarty's 2018 novel is -- as my grandmother used to say -- all over the shop."
Behind Her Eyes,0,"Here's my general opinion: I like a good twist, but the twist in Behind Her Eyes is a groaner. The series switches genres, and the final chapter felt to me like a slap in the face -- when it didn't make me laugh out loud at the absurdity."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"Leslie and James do their best to keep the series afloat, but it falls to pieces around them, slowly but surely."
Moon Knight,0,"...audiences that are looking for a unique and dynamic approach to one of the more unorthodox heroes in Marvels repertoire, Moon Knight is a disappointment."
The Big Conn,0,"The Big Conn bites off plenty, and occasionally more than it should chew, distending its scope to the point that it loses sight of Conn, whose over-the-top brazenness is the most interesting aspect of this saga."
The X-Files,0,"A lot of the return to night is devoted to chase scenes and makes one appreciate by comparison how much better a reboot ""Twin Peaks"" was last year."
Normal People,0,"We were shown banal locations and left to guess what was going on in the characters' minds as they stumbled for words or stared out of windows. That can work in a novel, with its internal monologues, but not on television."
Breaking Bad,0,"The second half of season five had some great individual episodes, but felt slightly schematic. And the show's finale was maybe the most conventional of the entire series."
Gossip Girl,0,"With age comes wisdom? Whoever said that should have passed the memo to the Gossip Girl gang, because after six seasons, they're still as clueless as ever."
Mare of Easttown,0,"Winslet is good in this ""Broadchurch''-meets-""The Killing""-meets-""True Detective""-meets-""Top of the Lake."" Otherwise, same-old-same-old."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,Is to its audience kind of like Tranquillum House is to the group of troubled men and women who decide to stay there: a place that sounds like a great investment on paper but feels confusing and not quite what you expected once you arrive.
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"In Anatomy of a Scandal, there is the matter of what constitutes consent and what is rape. But the muddled storytelling leaves the victim behind."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"The Punisher Season 2 isn't the worst season of Marvel TV on Netflix, but it's a pale shadow of its first season glory, and that's its biggest problem."
Taboo,0,"This tale sometimes feels like what might have happened if Sweeney Todd went after the East India Company, but it's weighed down by less-than-thrilling characterization."
The Shrink Next Door,0,The majority of The Shrink Next Door evokes too much cringe to be sustainably enjoyable.
Gaslit,0,"If the series accomplishes nothing else, it’s guaranteed to teach a few audience members stories they didn’t know before. It’s just too bad that in its messiness, Gaslit stops somewhere short of doing them justice."
And Just Like That...,0,"Far too many 2021 cultural touchstones and new characters are awkwardly parachuted into the luscious looking Michael Patrick King executive produced revival of sorts, as if to check a box."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,0,"This final season is an awkward combination of tones, as it aims to be both insightful and funny and ends up being neither."
A Teacher,0,"Mara and Robinson really are excellent, and the series has unsettling atmosphere to spare. But outside of some specific moments in its second half, A Teacher feels as superficial and generic as its title."
Loot,0,The greatest crime of Loot is how much it fails its leading lady.
The Thing About Pam,0,"When the Coen Brothers-inspired tone works, it's deliciously satisfying. But then you remember that this entertainingly stranger-than-fiction story wouldn't exist if innocent people hadn't died, and you feel little queasy."
The Wheel of Time,0,"While there is enough violence and faux-mysticism to keep genre fans happy, convincing human interactions are harder to find."
First Kill,0,"As a cheesy teen soap with supernatural elements, First Kill holds some promise, but that quickly dissipates as the eight-episode season progresses."
How I Met Your Mother,0,"In spite of a couple of lovely moments, the ""HIMYM"" finale was a terrible miscalculation."
Joe vs Carole,0,"Tiger King’s appeal was its proximity to reality, and the voyeuristic thrill of watching a convoluted and undeniably loopy story. Joe vs Carole merely photocopies it, resulting in something neither illuminating nor emotionally cathartic."
The Witcher,0,"In its attempt to build a bigger world, the series falls prey to more fantasy tropes than it masters."
House of Cards,0,"House of Cards...trashes itself, even if it was a sort of knowing trash to start with."
The Beatles: Get Back,0,Seven hours of boredom that test the beatlemania of the most devoted beatlemaniac. [Full review in Spanish]
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"It reeks of prestige, but Scenes From a Marriage ultimately lacks the warmth, humour or universality to be truly great. In the end, it's just a slightly pallid imitation of life."
Normal People,0,"Their love story is sweet, with many truthful moments of beauty and heartache... But despite the long timespan of the series' events, the characters' emotional arcs move at a much slower pace and become lost in the minutiae."
WeCrashed,0,"WeCrashed trods a more than a well-worn path, as Apple TV+ joins the list of streamers eager to capitalize on the con artist trend."
Big Little Lies,0,"You don't hire a director like Arnold, with a distinct visual style, say that's what you want, and then edit it to be unrecognizable."
Normal People,0,"Beyond illustrating the angst of their mutual attraction with a thousand penetrating angles, Normal People's TV adaptation fails as both an adaptation and as a standalone show. Without the details of the book, the story is featureless erotica."
The Queen's Gambit,0,"""Alma's not pathetic, she's just stuck,"" says Beth about her adopted mother. I can't think of a better way to summarize this unfortunately arrested miniseries."
Invasion,0,"It's unclear whether these alien visitors have all the time in the world waiting around for somebody to get to the point, but a lot of us mere mortals don't."
Vigil,0,"According to the end credits, Vigil has been made with support from the Scottish government, which makes no secret of its opposition to nuclear weapons. That may hint at an extra political edge, but doesn't make this a compelling drama."
30 Rock,0,"Anyone returning, hoping for the old Rock rather than the new, is bound to be disappointed in this strained outing."
First Kill,0,"First Kill is a soapy supernatural star-crossed romance that doesn’t break any new ground in the genre, or elevate itself above the other mediocre series of its ilk."
Amazing Stories,0,"The show seems to be an intentional throwback, trading on Spielberg nostalgia to draw those who recognize the original, or just its family-friendly appeal, into Apple's orbit -- but it comes off more dated than deliberately retro."
Foundation,0,"It would be enjoyable if they had a bit more fun with it, but watching it felt like I was in a meeting."
The Stand,0,"Unfortunately, the sabotage of the novel's truly enthralling story-telling leaves its ideology as its strongest element."
And Just Like That...,0,The show did not achieve what they were trying to and felt very heavy-handed in its themes.
Prison Break,0,The not-so-good news about Prison Break is that the suspension of disbelief it requires is simply a bridge too far.
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Sometimes it seems to be a lampoon of New Age self-help fads; other times, an encomium to self-lacerating encounter-group culture; and occasionally, a creepy stalker drama. These are not the makings of a good jigsaw puzzle."
Halo,0,"Extremely generic sci-fi, and incredibly different from the source material in ways that are not justified.  This just doesn't cut it in the ultra competitive streaming arena."
The Wheel of Time,0,"The Wheel Of Time is definitely a talky mess of a show, at least to start. It throws a lot of characters at us, but somehow all the time taken to establish them doesn't give us any more idea about them than when the episode started."
Bel-Air,0,"All the humour, warmth and character of the original has been sucked out and replaced with... nothing, really."
Outer Range,0,A lot of people do good work on “Open Range.” If only it provided a little more to hold onto.
Midnight Mass,0,Flanagan's study of religion and immortality sometimes rekindles memories of actual midnight masses in that it can be a little exhausting in its preachiness with a few too many monologues.
And Just Like That...,0,"I won't lie - at some level, it's nice to catch up with them. But it lacks the spark of Sex and the City. Now it's just another show."
You,0,"More and more, the show seems to be saying, Joe's struggles are just a slightly amped-up version of the viewer's own. He's ""You."" But there's too much grotesque violence in the show's past for us to relate to him, or to take the show on its own terms."
Devs,0,"It's the overdetermined plot that's leaving little room for the characters to develop... They lack warmth, wit and human singularity."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,0,"It's a noble ambition, but one that surely Stewart must realize precious few viewers will stick around for without some jokes to leaven the proceedings."
Y: The Last Man,0,"Vaughan and Guerra have writing credits on the new series, but the irreverence of the original seems to have been scrubbed in favor of a more somber approach."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Its story plays out the debate, but its form is firmly on Witherspoon's side. In the main, this is a show too aware of its pedigree and its importance to drive home its arguments with anything but the most earnest sort of gravity."
Foundation,0,"Lacking wit or self-awareness, Goyer's robot future is every bit as cold as you'd expect from a space adventure that's actually all about algebra."
Behind Her Eyes,0,"Behind Her Eyes just doesn't know what it wants to be and takes itself far too seriously, resulting in a muddled mess that could - and should - have been cut short."
Losing Alice,0,"Apple's new miniseries looks gorgeous, but its cinematic sensibilities don't quite make for gripping telly..."
WeCrashed,0,"In general, the series is a bit like the neon ""Hustle Harder"" signs that adorn the WeWork offices we see here -- flashy but vague."
What If...?,0,"The light fun of it is eaten away by the cynicism from within the project, that what purports to be about infinite possibilities is blatantly more about repurposing."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Give me Hugh Laurie doing Agatha Christie, any day, over hysterical tosh like Anatomy of a Scandal."
After Life,0,"Treated with a little more care, I suppose all of this could be saying really interesting things about male failure and loneliness. It's lazy, though. No idea or message is ever pursued. Nothing is."
House of Cards,0,"Robin Wright was one of the best things from the previous seasons of House of Cards, but season 6 simple should've never existed. The ghost of Frank Underwood became its doom. Full review in Spanish"
Invasion,0,"Perhaps it's simply that I've watched Independence Day too many times, but there's nothing about this show that's even particularly enjoyable, let alone fun."
Amazing Stories,0,"Without spoiling too much,""The Cellar"" feels overstuffed with narrative jumps and character choices that are often puzzling."
Girls,0,Girls overreached. There just aren't six seasons worth of interesting material for the average millennial girl to live through without bringing in sensational elements that go above and beyond an average reality.
Pieces of Her,0,The latest example of a miniseries that long overstays its welcome.
Roar,0,"A series with certain traits of audacity that wants to make a statement about female empowerment in these revolutionizing times, but often does so with more clumsiness than intelligence. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Mysterious Benedict Society,0,"The first two episodes have a start-and-stop energy, with more tests leading to more tests, and it gets more and more tedious."
After Life,0,"Hardcore fans of the show - which are legion - will mourn its passing, but for the rest of us, Gervais's maudlin curio remains a kind of purgatory."
The Staircase,0,"Campos brings visual panache to the project, but can never quite surmount the old aphorism that truth is stranger than fiction."
Snowflake Mountain,0,"It’s hard to determine how much of Solomon’s “personality” is genuine, but at least he provides some much-needed drama in this largely lacklustre series, which starts out so promisingly but soon peters out faster than a Gen Z doing the dishes."
Stranger Things,0,"The scrappy, soulful energy that defined Stranger Things‘ early seasons has been thrown out the window, and all that’s left is a parade of ’80s movies Easter eggs and increasingly obvious plot twists."
The Stand,0,"Somehow this isn't really what I want to watch in the throes of COVID 19, especially as it's not a great adaptation."
The Gilded Age,0,HBO hired Julian Fellowes to make a Downton Abbey out of 1880s NYC. But all the fussy costumes and jewelry in the world can’t bring The Gilded Age’s story of old vs. new money to life.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,0,"By the time of its seventh and final season, there was a feeling that many of the cast just wanted it all to be over - something unfortunately reflected in the performances."
Vikings: Valhalla,0,"One beard only has to look at another beard and that’s it, throat slit. This has, in short, not been approached with any wit or humour or cleverness."
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,"There's just too much stuff to really do justice to any of it, and that lack of focus makes it tough to latch on to anything the season is trying to do."
Brave New World,0,"While it looks pretty, it feels thin. Entire stretches are given over to PG-rated orgies instead of clearly explaining the plot. Moreover, a TV series where audiences are supposed to sympathize with the bored and unhappy one percent feels out of touch."
Euphoria,0,Season 2 is exactly what a drama seeking to spark conversation fears most: It's skippable.
And Just Like That...,0,"If the iconic image of ""Sex and the City"" is its central quartet striding down a Manhattan sidewalk, this is a series on its back heels: defensive, reactive, terrified to offend."
Devs,0,"Of course the characters don't have free will. That would require imagination, something Devs can only simulate."
The Night Of,0,"Actor/producer James Gandolfini's last project was meant to be a stirring indictment of the criminal justice system. Instead, it plays like an overwrought NYPD Blue episode."
Outlander,0,When we return to Fraser’s Ridge things start out a little slow -- and not in the good “let’s just hang out with the family” kind of way.
Guilty Party,0,"It's clear that Guilty Party has set out to spin a narrative about a complicated woman working a complicated case. But at this point in the story, the whole thing seems on the verge of buckling under one complication too many."
The Old Man,0,"The Old Man hits all the beats of a standard spy thriller and delivers some bone-crunching action, but the personal stuff falls flat. It strikes a meditative tone, without giving us much to meditate on."
WandaVision,0,"I'm like, where you going with this?"
The Sinner,0,The Sinner feels more like a familiar mystery series than it did at the best points in the first three years.
Moon Knight,0,"Moon Knight, literally and figuratively, has dissociative identity disorder -- in the battle for coherent narrative, at least, and infrequently summoning the suit just doesn't cut through all that clutter."
Big Shot,0,"It's a mess, and it doesn't even have the good grace to be a fun one."
Reacher,0,"""Reacher” will never be more interesting than Reacher, and he may have finally found the medium that fits too loosely over his big-and-tall frame."
Stranger Things,0,"For every fun and exciting element introduced, there is an overwhelming mushy gray pile of slog to wade through."
The Wheel of Time,0,"It's hard to get lost in this world when it feels so emotionally distant, so scattered, and so packed with thin plotlines."
Hawkeye,0,"""Hawkeye"" is too beholden to the larger MCU as a guiding narrative force and generic house style of filming to truly find its own voice..."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,0,"Surprisingly, the comedy is the shakiest part early on... The second episode is more caustically funny but also more scattershot."
Prison Break,0,This was most definitely not the way I wanted nor expected season five to get underway. But here's hoping somehow the show is able to catch its footing because Ogygia was a complete and utter letdown.
Mindhunter,0,Mindhunter stumbles by linking the intimate lives of its protagonists with those of the psychopaths they interview and stalk. [Full Review in Spanish]
Waco,0,The boilerplate exposition feels stilted and someone needs to get Shannon a cup of coffee.
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,Light on romantic chemistry and heavy on the cringe.
The Pentaverate,0,"That the resulting show isn’t good doesn’t especially matter, in the end. It’ll probably still find enough curious viewers to justify the partnership, and for Netflix, that’ll be more than enough."
Entourage,0,"The show's best days are behind it, and the eighth-and-final-season curtain appears to be coming down none too soon."
Heroes,0,It's legitimately incomprehensible that the show's producers have jobs.
Joe vs Carole,0,"In practice, Joe vs. Carole feels like a brutally over-extended Saturday Night Live sketch, leaning heavily on the jokes we know and expect while clumsily trying to tease out some deeper meaning."
The Nevers,0,"This is really unpleasant, and that is all I have."
Wolf Like Me,0,Wolf Like Me takes its traumatic situation so seriously I kept waiting for it to let its hair down.
11.22.63,0,"Awkward and flat, never matching the promise of its premise."
WeCrashed,0,"There is little here that is enjoyable to watch and even less that is entertaining, and spending eight hours with the versions of these people portrayed by Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway is a punishment."
Sex/Life,0,This epitomizes trash TV; it's a soapy melodrama that could be interpreted either as emotional or hilarious depending on the viewer's interpretation.
Behind Her Eyes,0,Anything beneath the surface in Behind Her Eyes is irrelevant by the end.
House of Cards,0,"With or without Kevin Spacey, it's possible that House of Cards had simply run its course. It's just a shame that it couldn't make one final sprint toward the finish line."
The Summer I Turned Pretty,0,"The series, which evokes YA soaps like The OC and Gossip Girl, is pleasant enough, if blandly formulaic: full of breathless kisses, swim suits, dances, and mood-supporting pop songs - plus boozing, hooking up, and cheating, bathed in fumbling innocence."
The Last Man on Earth,0,The Last Man on Earth remains very much on the bubble.
The Old Man,0,"The veteran actor does nuanced work as usual, but the FX series takes too many ridiculous turns."
WeCrashed,0,Apple TV's first high-profile letdown doesn't know whether to satirise WeWork founder Adam Neumann or to idolise him.
Entourage,0,"""Entourage"" heads into its final eight episodes starting Sunday night and to be honest, it's time."
Big Shot,0,"If you're over ten years old, you've seen everything here before."
Marvel's Agent Carter,0,It became... nothing more than a Hayley Atwell vehicle that let everything else from production value to narrative importance fall to the wayside if it meant the show's lead actress getting in just one extra spunky line of dialogue.
The Pentaverate,0,"Underneath its mildly amusing, emotionally scattered exterior, The Pentaverate is a flawed but heartfelt ode to the importance of honesty in an era where lies are widespread and popularized."
Ginny & Georgia,0,"Unfortunately, the show's ambitions for bigger stakes mean trading in some of the character-based intimacy that is the series' calling card. Go big or go home, they say - but Ginny & Georgia makes a strong case for staying cozy."
Succession,0,"Season three cares only for its mic drop moments. Succession has no grasp of narrative pacing, a show that gives its audience little to invest in beyond amusing one-liners."
And Just Like That...,0,"Modernizing the original's much-beloved and extremely glamorous world has for some reason meant making it drearier, more awkward, and overall less joyful to inhabit."
Tokyo Vice,0,"For all its visual pleasures, “Tokyo Vice” is guilty of sidelining its most fascinating characters. And with so many other streaming shows fighting for our attention, that’s a punishable offense."
Why Women Kill,0,"The ensuing lurid shenanigans are cartoonish to a campy extreme, and it's hard to care who'll end up killing whom in their venal, petty squabbles."
Halo,0,The early episodes of Paramount+’s much-delayed new adaptation of the classic video game series miss their target...
Bridgerton,0,"Although it's hardly a failure, Bridgerton Season 2 suffers from too many extraneous storylines and not focusing enough on its leading two characters, and that's where it falls short."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,It's a shame such a wild and impulsive character is likely going out on such an underwhelming note.
The Nevers,0,As creaky as these first four episodes are - reams of exposition alternating between soap-opera twists and cutesy inventions like Penance's li'l electric car - I want to believe there are glimmers of promise.
Rise,0,"The cast is solid, but otherwise ""Rise"" falls flat."
The Mist,0,"Like King's last TV series, ""Under the Dome,"" ""The Mist"" would seem to have a short shelf life. One hour with these people and you'll be rooting for the critters."
All of Us Are Dead,0,It's delivered in an oddly-paced season that fights against an intuitive structure as much as these students try to beat back chomps from throngs of kids in uniforms.
Treadstone,0,"While lots of action films require the audience to suspend disbelief at times, Treadstone requires them to saw the tops of their own heads off and remove the gooey blob inside. It's the only way you'll survive the writing."
Taboo,0,"As Taboo goes forward, Delaney's mystical powers will inevitably play a more central role, but as of now, the promise that the show has some payoffs hidden up its sleeve isn't enough to slog through the dampness with these characters."
Jericho,0,Whom can you trust? What can you do? Where the hell is this going?
The Mist,0,"The only times The Mist manages to escape the obvious is in the story of a possible teen sexual assault, which feels slightly more rooted in character and reality but takes a backseat to the show's title malevolent force."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"Without a compelling character at the heart of it, Mayor of Kingstown is simply a dreary march toward predictable violence."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,The Punisher season two is relentlessly blood and guts and that unfortunately is just punishing on to itself after a while.
And Just Like That...,0,"Samantha Jones's perverted yet sensible energy was what kept this show together, and without her, these women are in big trouble."
Parenthood,0,"The writers' decision to go full cheeseball ending shouldn't have been surprising, after the show spent its last year turning into a frustrating shadow of itself."
Mr. Corman,0,"Stop me if you already saw this indulgent indie flick back in the early 90s, because trust me -- you did."
The Affair,0,Cringeworthy: that is the only descriptor for the events that transpire throughout this episode.
Casual,0,"Somehow... the series keeps from being overwhelmed by all the changes, either to its characters or the world around them, and winds up in delivering an emotionally satisfying end to one of Hulu's most charming and enjoyable series."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,An incredibly frustrating story that never quite brings all of its ideas home.
Lovecraft Country,0,"Rather than weaving the elements of the show together to buttress each other, Lovecraft Country simply piles up a bunch of horror tropes for no discernible reason."
The Twilight Zone,0,"For its final episode, The Twilight Zone gives us something it spent most of its time railing against: a happy ending of perfect, selfish bliss."
Schmigadoon!,0,"Strong, who's one of the producers, is clearly having a ball, but Key is sold shockingly short by a lame script that starves him of funny lines and requires him to do nothing but moan."
Rick and Morty,0,Season 5 of Rick And Morty is worryingly uneven for the cartoon that breathed new life into the medium.
Killing Eve,0,"Groundbreaking when it began, the caper starring Jodie Comer and Sandra Oh as cat and mouse, should probably have ended a couple of seasons back. What started as Tom and Jerry now resembles the complicated romance in Krazy Kat."
The Wheel of Time,0,You know what? I think the screen version might be even worse than the book.
Wolf Like Me,0,"So bad it's good? No, just the former..."
Ramy,0,"When it comes to the politics of Islam, supposedly one of the main focuses of the show, Youssef shies from delving into the growing division between secular and traditional Islam. It's here where the ideology of the show grows even more muddled."
Ozark,0,"The show enters its final seven episodes with a problem: How do you create credible foes and foils for the Byrde's in such a short amount of time?... These rivalries feel like temporary fixes, band-aids applied to a gaping head wound."
Under the Dome,0,"Under the Dome limped toward the finish, all right. But it's because the show shot itself in the foot."
And Just Like That...,0,There were many inclusivity themes as a lunge for relevance that only make you remember how funny and risky the un-PC Samantha could have made it.
Stranger Things,0,"This is the very definition of “treading water TV”, despite its big-budget fanciness, Stranger Things is really no different from any generic network procedural."
Line of Duty,0,"As we embark on series six, a far greater problem is the weight of the past. As the plot races on, names and events float to the surface of my consciousness like something disturbing in a canal."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"""Mayor of Kingstown"" appears tailor-made to be forever confused with 100 other shows like it, shackled and forgotten in its allegiance to an outdated template."
Bel-Air,0,"The missing element here is the camp of a juicy soap. If we can’t laugh, then we should gasp. Remaking an iconic series is a silly endeavor—why not lean all the way into that?"
The Endgame,0,"Morena Baccarin and Ryan Michelle Bathe, longtime supporting players getting starring roles in a large-scale series for the first time, do not feel irreplaceable, and the show's clunky, obvious writing doesn't give them much to work with."
The First Lady,0,The First Lady could have been great.
Brave New World,0,"It spends so much time reveling in its own aesthetic that dramatic momentum becomes an afterthought. At the same time, there are real ideas contained within the nine-part series. Some of them are actually in the book."
Amazing Stories,0,"Fluffy and safe, it's not the strongest endorsement of what the rest of the series might bring."
The Book of Boba Fett,0,The Book of Boba Fett is beyond even an experiment. It should be a bellwether for future writers and producers – because it takes us all for granted.
Hawkeye,0,"Acknowledging that the character is the least-exciting Avenger can be fun in small doses, but it's not a thing to base an entire series on."
Chucky,0,"Ultimately, there are better, scarier things you can be watching than Chucky."
Looking for Alaska,0,"""Looking For Alaska"" is nostalgic for itself, like it's admiring itself in a mirror instead of making eye contact. This neutralizes the immediacy and intimacy that can make coming-of-age stories so special."
Stranger Things,0,"The latest season of ‘Stranger Things’ may have some issues with bloated running times and narrative continuity, but hey, at least Steve Harrington continues to be charming as hell, right?"
The Shrink Next Door,0,"Watching the story unfold, as Rudd's psychiatrist manipulates Ferrell's patient utterly and completely over the course of decades,is sometimes like scraping your knuckles on a cheese grater."
Ozark,0,"When each scene is over, it evaporates in the perpetual churn of increasingly insupportable plot points."
The Gilded Age,0,Wharton is unlikely to have approved of such a half-hearted imitation of her work.
The O.C.,0,"Too ironic to be a soap, but too soapy to be a parody. Take this season's dismal debut: a clunky, dark hour in which hunky Ryan brooded... He should have mourned instead the loss of the show's last, best quality-an ability to make fun of itself."
Sharp Objects,0,"Adams is good, ""Sharp Objects"" is deadly slow."
Fear the Walking Dead,0,"Colman Domingo was as good as always, but all the exposition dumps and plot holes really dragged the [premiere] down, blunting what could have -- in more adept hands -- been a strong opener for Season Seven."
Losing Alice,0,"It might have worked effectively as a 3-hour movie, but at 7 hours doled out over eight episodes, Losing Alice dribs and drabs, but mostly drabs."
First Kill,0,"First Kill features excellent chemistry between the two leads, and interesting lore, but the dialogue isn’t doing this story any favors. Even though there is potential, season one takes too long to find its footing."
Joe vs Carole,0,"Though it's based on the Wondery podcast that first broke the tawdry tiger tale in 2019, Joe vs. Carole simply doesn't contain enough fresh insight to justify its existence today  despite game performances by the stars."
Mad Men,0,"There are peaks and valleys, but mostly there's a lot of flat, ugly middle. The victories that you spend forever building end up being as ephemeral as fireworks, sparkling briefly before quickly fading back into the endless blackness of the nighttime sky."
Rise,0,"... Rise feels like a rehash, a collection of stories we've already seen, presented with a slightly darker palette."
The Lincoln Lawyer,0,"The Lincoln Lawyer is fine, but it's nothing special."
The Staircase,0,"To call The Staircase a docu-series is a gross exaggeration. It is filmed entirely from the perspective of Peterson's team, an overwrought exploration of a self-involved family."
Treadstone,0,Treadstone... just treads a lot of narrative water.
Rise,0,Imagine if Glee and Friday Night Lights had a baby and that child overdosed on Lifetime movies.
The Sopranos,0,"David Chase, after so much brilliant work... seemed to be saying he could take it or leave it. So he left it."
The Morning Show,0,"The plot became a haphazard mess, motivations were mysterious, no two storylines tied together, and the cast foundered. Saying it was off the rails was an insult to train derailments everywhere."
Lisey's Story,0,"Add a relentlessly repetitive narrative structure, and the show is left with precious little space to let dread build, to make the scary things scary and the emotional things moving."
Community,0,"Ultimately, Community has written itself into a hole that I'm not sure it will be able to dig out of."
Amazing Stories,0,"I'm a fan of sci-fi anthologies, so I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of Amazing Stories in spite of its lukewarm opener episode."
Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,0,"It quickly plummets into your bog-standard, formulaic Dan Brown storyline in which Langdon is a helpless prisoner of a contrived, all-constraining plot."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"If we wanted to watch a show that's relentlessly grim, there are much better choices out there."
Sex/Life,0,"Whatever inherent truths the show explores -- marriage is hard, the magic/romance fades, etc. -- get overshadowed by the wanton silliness."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,You won't be missing much if you give this season a skip.
13 Reasons Why,0,"13 Reasons Why was frustrating and difficult, but it's over, and there will be no looking back."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"The Time Traveler's Wife focuses so much on the time travel element, it fails to build the relationship between the lead characters, which should be the heart of the series."
The Stand,0,"Sadly there is very seldom any notion of stakes, of consequence, or of danger in this ultimately lifeless adaptation."
Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area,0,A disappointment that I've no interest in perpetuating. [Full review in Spanish]
Slow Horses,0,Deja vu is my primary experience of Slow Horses.
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"I think the most off-putting thing about The Time Traveler’s Wife, right from the jump, is how strangely chintzy and thin it looks."
Brave New World,0,"The series looks gorgeous, and expensive, even if its sci-fi brutalist aesthetic is a bit generic. The performances are solid, too... Yet something is missing from the show's core... I struggled to get invested in this bunch."
Brave New World,0,"As it unfolds, ""Brave New World"" fits only the most nebulous sense of the word ""interesting,"" with its most relevant commentary left behind in the Savage Lands."
Defending Jacob,0,"""Defending Jacob"" has great ingredients, but the portion size is off."
Star Trek,0,Talk about going out on a sour note.
The Nevers,0,"The Nevers doesn't want for narrative, but it feels like Whedon throwing all the Buffy-lite ideas he had together ... and hoping some of it would gel."
Lisey's Story,0,"""Stephen King's Greatest Hits""...slow, obscure, structured to maximize the tedium and obscurity, and thus a little wearing."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,It is like I've gone to therapy on a Gwyneth Paltrow GOOP retreat... I feel like I have to go to therapy after suffering through.
The Night Of,0,"Everyone else, whether in jail, court, or the police station, is a variation on a character portrayed more distinctively in other TV shows."
Fargo,0,"The characters tend to be as thin as the story they inhabit, though, and vivid performers like Buckley and Esposito (of the Italian gangster series ""Gomorrah"") can't do much with the cartoons they've been given to play."
Our Flag Means Death,0,"Ultimately, it’s got enough amusing moments and talented performers to offer some comedic escapism once a week, but anyone looking for another “Shadows” or “Flight of the Conchords,” should sail to other waters."
Lost,0,The feel-good moments at the end don't make up for six seasons of stringing viewers along without ever providing any real answers or any real closure.
Wolf Like Me,0,"Wolf Like Me's supernatural elements are its weakest parts, delivered in wispy terms that make them indistinct and generic."
Defending Jacob,0,All the ingredients are in place to make Defending Jacob one of the year's best shows. Instead it's an average outing into an already crowded medium. And that's kind of indefensible.
The Twilight Zone,0,"As with most anthology series, the results are decidedly mixed. For one thing, the show does away with its social justice bent entirely at a time in which those stories would be most welcome."
How to Get Away With Murder,0,"It was melodramatic and more than a little manipulative -- descriptions that have applied to the show from the beginning, but which were more tolerable before the novelty of its serialized mystery format wore off."
Taboo,0,[Taboo] silently bullies you into a reverence it probably doesn't deserve.
Shining Girls,0,"Moss is obviously a draw, but even she can only do so much with thin and confusing material."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"Once Upon a Time in Wonderland is a disappointment, focusing more on the chintzy tableau of the candy-colored Wonderland than on giving its actors anything interesting to do there."
The Mosquito Coast,0,The tone-deaf tourism of The Mosquito Coast makes for an adventure that's increasingly difficult to go along with.
Brave New World,0,"Temperamentally so right-wing that I wish it were better. As it is, the series is merely tolerable, hampered by a lead-you-around-by-the-nose quality that is more in keeping with the network-TV ethos than with top-shelf cable drama."
Inventing Anna,0,"Inventing Anna is a meandering and shallow take on Anna Sorokin's story, glacially paced with superfluous tangents that distract from the character we're really interested in."
Sweet Tooth,0,"It seems unfair to call a drama about a ruined world a mess, but this feels, quite deliberately, all over the place."
Shadow and Bone,0,"More exhausting than thrilling, Netflix's latest period fantasy adventure, ""Shadow and Bone,"" will have a tough time breaking out of the fan base already built by the books."
The End of the F...ing World,0,Totally disappointing. [Full review in Spanish]
The Fall,0,"For all its psychological, almost literary complexity, it loses much of its narrative steam. It's that great 21st-century phenomenon: a show that's more fun to think about than it is to watch."
The Undoing,0,"The Undoing is gratingly off-key. It invites us to sympathise with poor, rich Grace as her bubble of privilege bursts. Not right now, thanks."
The Haunting of Hill House,0,"Like everything in Hill House, that terror gets muted, slowed down and picked over so much that it ends up banal and lifeless."
Bel-Air,0,"Suck all the joy, exuberance and wondrous charisma out of “The Fresh Prince” — a worthy launchpad for an actor who, in his prime, was widely considered the biggest movie star in the world — and you’re left with the gloomy and plodding “Bel-Air.”"
Limitless,0,"By the time viewers spend 45 minutes learning the rules, or lack thereof, of this extraordinary universe, sticking around to see what comes next may be less appealing."
Two and a Half Men,0,"I swear to God, I don't think I could come up with a worse ending."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,0,"In its first episode, The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers resembles its scrappy kids: uneasy on the ice and a little afraid to take shots."
The First Lady,0,"While it celebrates women who break the mold, the show itself is deeply — and dispiritingly — conventional."
Limitless,0,Turns out there are limits when it comes to adapting movies into TV-and the feeble sequel to 2011's Limitless is especially off-putting...
The Afterparty,0,"If you're a fan of Haddish or anyone else involved, I'd recommend you look for your yuks elsewhere. Billed as a genre-defying murder mystery, the only thing this tone-deaf pastiche-fest defies is a reason to be seen."
Bel-Air,0,A confusing series that's too tied to its sitcom roots to pass for a drama to take seriously. It's unclear with its intentions and doesn't justify its existence other than to underline a new era of streaming that's starved for content.
Guilty Party,0,"While a 30-minute dramatic series is often welcome, ""Guilty Party"" might have been better suited to a one-hour format that would allow Addelman and her team to flesh out the characters and their motivations as well as fine tune the tone."
Chernobyl,0,"What makes one kind of false representation-language and accent-more acceptable than another, such as race?"
Inventing Anna,0,"The show certainly provides indulgence (if maybe not enough for my taste). Its failure is in the framing of Delvey’s story: It’s depicted as a quasi-feminist, girlboss-adjacent revenge fantasy."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,"TFATWS boasts the rhythms & pacing of a film applied to the structure of a television show, without much thought devoted to how each medium works."
The Stand,0,"If you don't stand for something, you end up looking like a Walking Dead spin-off that never made it to the air."
The Gilded Age,0,"Julian Fellowes chased his new series, ""The Gilded Age,"" for a decade. Call it his white whale... you can watch it drag him and a large, talented cast beneath the waves."
Game of Thrones,0,Season eight made the regrettable mistake of giving half its time to an underwhelming villain at the expense of the characters who made the show special in the first place.
X-Men,0,Frankly - and it pains me to say this - it would be better if the final season of X-Men: The Animated Series didn't exist at all.
Lovecraft Country,0,"Pulp horror stories are best consumed in a single, quick encounter, before their limitations of plot and characterization become too obvious to ignore. Lovecraft Country is reduced to one of the walking dead long before its final credits roll."
Monsters at Work,0,"Has the feel of a weekday afternoon cartoon that was churned out quickly to capitalize on a successful property, featuring lesser versions of the franchise's characters."
Rise,0,"The writers rely too heavily on the cliches to develop characters, which leaves many of them underdeveloped or inconsistent."
Brave New World,0,There's nothing brave or new to see here.
Halo,0,Looks like a trial run that ran out of gas about halfway through.
Friends,0,"Altogether, Friends is really just a bland show about bland characters living bland lives."
Devs,0,"The problem, from a pure storytelling point of view, is that the show's tone, characters and narrative momentum have all surrendered to that same detached, emotionally isolated form of disaffection."
Weeds,0,"Pour one out to Showtime's Weeds, y'all. But not the good stuff. The show no longer deserves it."
Vikings: Valhalla,0,"Valhalla isn’t terrible. But it feels mostly like more of the same, without having much of an identity to itself. In a crowded landscape, that doesn’t give it a lot to fight for."
The Twilight Zone,0,"CBS All Access' reboot of The Twilight Zone rarely beats the audience at the guessing games it poses, or when it does, the twist is so basic as to be barely worth scoffing at."
The Alienist,0,"""The Alienist"" - which was originally critiqued for feeling behind the times and overly familiar - still plays like the worse version of so many other dramas."
The Stand,0,"Stripping this story of pretty much every shred of dramatic weight and emotional engagement is no easy task, but CBS has accomplished it"
30 Coins,0,"Bogged down in dull relationship drama and a confusing, mutating conspiracy, with only occasional flashes of the weird horror that the concept and the first episode's opening scenes promise."
Lisey's Story,0,"The Apple TV+ limited series lands in the shallow end of the King cinematic pool, with a convoluted story that mostly squanders its big-name cast."
The Essex Serpent,0,[The greater concepts] are squandered for the mundane banality of the people in this town.
Mr. Corman,0,"It's not dark enough or funny enough, or meaningful enough or irreverent enough."
The Pentaverate,0,"There are rare parts of The Pentaverate that demonstrate how Mike Myers' brand of humor can still feel fun and fresh here in 2022, but too much of it proves the opposite."
True Detective,0,"The season had its moments, but it felt more like a vehicle for delivering a type of experience than a discrete story divided into eight installments. What's good about this show is almost entirely eclipsed by what doesn't work."
A Wilderness of Error,0,Morris' book meticulously chronicled a wilderness of errors. All Smerling's documentary does is get lost in a wilderness of voices.
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Anatomy of a Scandal struggles to thread the needle between [its] two impulses, resulting in a show that’s unsatisfying as either a lurid thriller or a serious drama."
Stranger Things,0,"""Stranger Things"" is back after a three-year hiatus, but it's hard to say it's a welcome arrival."
Killing Eve,0,"With only eight episodes in the series, it’s time to stop idling and hit the gas pedal. And new characters and errant plot threads only hinder what should be the driving force of the series, namely the Eve and Villanelle relationship."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,0,"Due to its meandering nature and stretched out plot, the novel would have been better served as a well-structured film than a rambling TV series. Despite first rate performances from its stars, this is a show you’re likely to soon forget."
WeCrashed,0,"Unfortunately, caring about the demise of rich people is just outside my scope of interest, and I was left with little to care about for another episode of WeCrashed."
Twin Peaks,0,"The show, which derived its power from the aftermath of trauma in a small community, has chosen to tell a story that's odder and bigger -- so big, in fact, that it has so far choked off what made Twin Peaks work all along."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Because the cast is so strong, they bring some poignancy to these roles... These are all intriguing personalities. Yet Kelley and his writing and directing team can't find a definitive lens to frame what the story is meant to convey about them."
First Kill,0,First Kill could have been a fun teen supernatural series. But its storytelling is so clumsy it’s just very hard to watch.
Game of Thrones,0,"Game of Thrones finally finished, the last episode aptly titled The Long Night and it was a terrible ending, disappointing for fans, causing a collective cringe around the globe."
The Haunting of Hill House,0,The virtuosity in the style is evident. That's why it's a shame that [director and writer Mike] Flanagan neglects elementary aspects like the performances and the script. [Full review in Spanish]
The Gilded Age,0,"The Gilded Age is a feast for the eyes, and its aesthetic pleasures are undeniable -- but those are the only pleasures to be found here."
Sharp Objects,0,"The lead performance by Amy Adams as troubled reporter Camille Preaker keeps the show mostly watchable, but it's a chore to get through the dead-end subplots and the slow trickle of narrative developments that surround her."
Roar,0,"Mostly the stories hammer you over the head with their obviousness, then peter out."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"There's a lot of missteps on the show that make its fires go out quickly. From its aggressive ambitions to tackle a lot of things to its unsubtle and heavy-handed melodrama approach, Little Fires Everywhere obviously suffers from most of it."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"Herschkoph is inherently unlikable, decidedly shifty and lacking in moral fiber, while Markowitz simply misses a backbone. Epiphanies, gumption or redeemable characteristics are in short supply, meaning there is little to get behind as a viewer."
Hannibal,0,It's difficult to love a show that seems to be trying to hard to be impenetrable to viewers to the point that it's practically begging to be canceled with such uninviting storytelling.
Brave New World,0,Disastrously walked into every known pitfall of trying to turn what is essentially a philosophical discourse into gripping drama. Even mediocre drama would have been a start.
The Offer,0,"Repetitive for anyone who’s seen the film, and condescendingly didactic for those who haven’t."
Legion,0,Legion is weird for weird's sake and seems content to do that right up to the end.
Loki,0,"It's interesting to think and write about-a show that's about control, order, chaos, and the unknowable notions of free will, determinism, and choice-but mildly entertaining, at best, as a whole."
The Beatles: Get Back,0,"There is a point, about five hours in, when the prospect of hearing another ramshackle version of Don't Let Me Down becomes an active threat to the viewer's sanity."
The Stand,0,"It's curiously bland, devoid of most of the scares that King is known for, and telling a straightforward story in a faithful but lifeless manner."
The Queen's Gambit,0,A glamorous Anya Taylor-Joy doesn't show the true cost of addiction - but rather a rose-tinted view of womanhood and paint-by-numbers redemption.
Bodyguard,0,Bodyguard adds to a long and damaging media trend of depicting brown people as terrorists.
First Kill,0,It's Buffy meets Riverdale in the worst/best way possible.
Godless,0,"Godless is so swept up in the romance of the West that it shortchanges practically everything else -- character, context, story."
The Pentaverate,0,"Got some good laughs out of the first three episodes, but I grew weary."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,0,"You can violate the laws of the universe you created, using a raft of new characters in whom we have no investment, or you can drag nine episodes' worth of doing so over 22 hours of TV. Not both."
Twin Peaks,0,"A collection of rambling and samey set pieces amateurishly glued together by a frankly adolescent conviction that weirdness in any form -- hey, let's not bother with a plot -- can pass for clever and interesting, it should never have been made."
The Beatles: Get Back,0,"As a document of the breakdown of the Beatles, Get Back seems to exist for posterity rather than enjoyment."
The Pentaverate,0,"Although its fantastic to have Mike Myers back in action, the series is underwhelming in elaborating its premise and comedy. [Full review in Spanish]"
Peacemaker,0,"Gunn has given himself and his actors more room to play than he's ever been allotted - eight hours' worth - and hasn't figured out how to fill it with anything but the same labored joke, again and again and again."
Monsters at Work,0,"Monsters At Work will reward long-time fans of this franchise with familiar characters, callbacks, and more time in the intriguing world of Monstropolis. Unfortunately, all it nails about this world is superficial, and not even appropriately rendered."
Bel-Air,0,It’s probably the most 2022 thing imaginable to take one adored show and reboot it in a way that feels derivative of at least a half-dozen other shows.
Brave New World,0,"For the most part, we're left with an unsexy portrait of decadence, a thriller without thrills, a prescription that's less soma than Sominex."
Boardwalk Empire,0,"So many great actors, so little for most of them to do. Good acting can get you through times of confused and misguided writing, but can only take a show so far."
Prison Break,0,"As is so often the case, creating buzz worthy content doesn't necessarily translate into content that justifies its existence beyond causing a stir. That's largely how Prison Break feels."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,Some books really might be unadaptable.
Pretty Little Liars,0,It's time for Pretty Little Liars to put us out of our misery once and for all. It's an act of mercy that we all deserve.
The Offer,0,The depictions of real-life actors border on mimicry... The various Mafia personages appear to have watched The Godfather once too often.
Ginny & Georgia,0,"Ginny & Georgia winds down its punishingly long first season having shouted a great deal, but said almost nothing at all."
And Just Like That...,0,"And Just Like That... isn't nearly as clever, funny or as interesting as it thinks it is."
A Teacher,0,"That economy is one noticeable thing about ""A Teacher."" More noticeable is how seldom it feels like a cautionary tale, despite the onscreen cautions and referrals to sexual assault resources and the story's occasional explicit references."
Moon Knight,0,"Flashes of brilliance offer a glimpse of the more introspective, imaginative show we were promised, and the finale has the opportunity to deliver. As it stands, though, Marvel Studios' latest Disney+ outing is also its most disappointing."
The Afterparty,0,How does something with such sparky potential come to feel so strangely flat?
Turner & Hooch,0,"Fans of the original may mine some nostalgia from this new take on the story but beyond that, this series should end up in the pound."
BoJack Horseman,0,"I've faithfully followed BoJack Horseman from its beginning, and have frequently found it quite funny and fitfully touching, but as time goes on I find it more difficult to fully embrace the show as a meaningful work."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,A story that lacks strength... torn between what it wants to tell and how. [Full review in Spanish]
Archive 81,0,Is Archive 81 the silliest show on telly? Probably not -- but it certainly comes close.
Behind Her Eyes,0,"It's creepy and engaging throughout the early chapters. But then? Well... then, Behind Her Eyes becomes a different kind of story altogether, and a much sillier one."
Outer Range,0,"Outer Range has one of the worst momentum problems I've ever seen in a streaming show, squandering an evocative setting and some fun twists on portentous take-forever storytelling that prioritizes hints over character depth."
This Is Going to Hurt,0,"I’m not someone -- this is not a newsflash -- who demands that characters be likeable, let alone that their experiences “resonate” (ugh) with my own. Unlikeability, however, is a problem here."
Fargo,0,"If all of this sounds like a lot of strands to tie together, it is-but unlike in previous seasons, many of these strands really feel ancillary to the gangland drama that stodgily occupies center stage."
Watchmen,0,"There's a lot going on in Watchmen. Actually, there's too much, a surplus of narrative, too many three-minute set pieces that don't advance the story, and way, way too many flashbacks."
True Blood,0,"In its final season, the series seems to have exhausted its stores of surprises."
Amazing Stories,0,"Ultimately, its central characters - Sam and Evelyn - never really come alive, and their love story is as generic as it comes."
True Blood,0,Headaches will be induced just in trying to unravel the plot mess Bon Temps finds itself in. At least this will be the last headache.
Mad Men,0,The season premiere seems as exhausted as the decade it has chronicled so intensely.
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"This Iron Fist ain't immortal, he's got a real short shelf life."
Snowflake Mountain,0,"If their newest reality series becomes a success, we should only expect more of this sort of bootlicking, conservative garbage in the future."
Riverdale,0,"If the minds behind the show don't seem to care enough about the season 5 cliffhangers to start with them, why should the audience?"
Defending Jacob,0,Defending Jacob feels like a huge miss for Apple TV+.
House of Cards,0,"In the moments when Claire is allowed not just the camera but the story, ""House of Cards"" is a ride; when the past is relitigated and the specter of Frank rears up once more, it feels like that worst thing a binge-able drama can be: a trudge."
Euphoria,0,"There were some great moments, but this season could have been better. You really wanted to see more for all of these characters because the actors are genuinely so talented. You don't want to see characters be pushed to the side."
Starstruck,0,"The reason why romantic comedies never have sequels is because either everything is going well with the couple and there’s nothing to watch. Or, there is conflict and the original love story is ruined. Starstruck’s second season suffers from the latter."
The First Lady,0,"For all its glossy production values and talented leads, a few episodes in The First Lady starts to show fatigue, like three highly padded made-for-TV movies spliced together."
Heroes,0,"The fourth season of Heroes ended not with a bang, not with a whimper, but with a collective synchronized shrug."
The Flight Attendant,0,"The writing is an insult to the acting caliber of all involved, especially the usually wonderful Zosia Mamet and new cast member Shohreh Aghdashloo."
Bel-Air,0,"It’s one thing to ask whether it would be great if the Fresh Prince premise was used in service of a grittier, more dramatic take on the story; it’s another to make that twist work over the long haul."
The Nevers,0,"There's a lot of that carelessness throughout The Nevers. Or maybe it's just that there's simply a lot happening in The Nevers, and it's hard to keep track of it all."
Lisey's Story,0,"Despite the involvement of starry names in front of and behind the camera, intriguing fantasy elements and fascinating themes, the show never achieves the resonance it seems to be reaching for"
Limitless,0,"Sad to see the great Jennifer Carpenter of Dexter in such a lesser cop show, another network one that tries to keep us past the commercial breaks with action and CGI razzle-dazzle."
Battlestar Galactica,0,"To be honest, I'm weary of Baltar and his endless visions/hallucinations, as I am of the fleet's wandering as the surviving colonists try, somewhat fitfully, to find their way back to a home planet none of them remembers."
Pieces of Her,0,"Toni Collette never misses, but shes left stranded here by a script that doesnt go far enough to provoke B-movie thrills and is structured in a way that drains anything that feels realistic."
The Pentaverate,0,"A less-than-stellar return to comedy for Mike Myers, featuring outdated jokes, an attempt at topicality that falls flat, and a waste of talented comedians."
Y: The Last Man,0,"The real undoing of Y: The Last Man... is that it takes itself too seriously to allow for many other emotions beyond ""desperate"" and ""grieving."""
Two and a Half Men,0,"A big, crude and unapologetically vulgar finale. In other words, it ended the only way it knew how."
The Undoing,0,"""The Undoing"" is somewhat undone by its dawdling pace."
The Witcher,0,"The show remains uneven and somewhat impenetrable to anyone not truly invested in it, which isn't helped by the long layoff."
WandaVision,0,WandaVision doesn't grasp gender or racial representation as well as it thinks it does.
Glee,0,"It's fitting, then, that the first hour ends with a Frozen cover that's over a year late to the zeitgeist... making it feel just as the show does: dull, overextended, and irrelevant. It's Glee's time-time to let it go."
Halo,0,This drama comes on strong with ambient techno-babble and bureaucratic realism. It's as thrilling as a meeting.
The First,0,"Sluggishly paced and too familiar in its character beats, it's the sort of prestige project that surely looked good on paper but fizzles once exposed to air."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,It's all meant to be a paean to the imagination. Too bad the effects pry some of us out of our imaginations and into the tech lab.
The Wheel of Time,0,"It does eventually bed in somewhat, but not as much as it should."
Watchmen,0,"Whether you're a student of the graphic novel or coming to the series without prior knowledge of Moore and Gibbons' work, HBO's ""Watchmen"" is likely to leave you feeling less than super."
Mr. Corman,0,It's disingenuous for [Joseph Gordon-Levitt] to try to get in the mind of the average man who doesn't know what he wants to do.
The Endgame,0,"The Endgame is by turns boring and by other turns generic and nonsensical. Its story isn’t compelling enough to follow beyond the first episode, and we’re figuring that the interplay between its stars isn’t enough to keep people watching."
Gaslit,0,Not even Roberts’s blistering portrayal of a woman terrorised into silence is enough to save a drama that is somehow both plodding and overreaching.
Lovecraft Country,0,The problem isn't that Lovecraft Country doesn't meet the expectation of a Lovecraft fan; the problem is that it uses Lovecraft tropes superficially and doesn't exploit their strengths.
The First Lady,0,"With such powerhouse actors on set, its a shame that the series is a jumbled collection of moments that barely glance upon what makes these women so special."
Loot,0,"Because [Rudolph] can do almost anything, a temptation exists to create roles that allow her to do everything. And that can result in a tonal jumble like Loot, which feels like a lot of great raw material in search of a series to make sense of it all."
Girls5eva,0,Despite some solid zingers... this sophomore batch of episodes feels listless.
The Good Wife,0,"Yes, Alicia strides out of the hallway composing herself, but the character and the show, feel a bit in tatters, kind of a let down from the promise the show has always had and a far cry from the greatness it was able to achieve."
The Boys,0,"You finish each episode with a nasty taste in your mouth, not helped by the fact that so many of the characters are so ghastly you wish they’d all self-explode and put us out of our misery."
Night Sky,0,"Simmons and Spacek give great performances but it’s unfortunately not enough to keep Night Sky from being a dull, boring, and forgettable show."
Defending Jacob,0,"For a show so devoted to stringing you along for answers, ""Defending Jacob"" doesn't leave you with much once it's over."
WeCrashed,0,"WeCrashed establishes that shameless hustlers worth billions, even when played by Academy Award winning movie stars, are not necessarily interesting people."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"The dull courtroom sequences occasionally slip into stagey reconstructions of what happened between defendant and accused. At no point does Kelley’s series pause to consider what it is it’s trying to say about, um, well, anything."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,The true scandal is how lazy it all feels.
The Nevers,0,"The Nevers is muddled, overcrowded, and less-than-engaging despite its complex lore and flashy special effects."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"It's an admirable effort, but one that simply underscores how unadaptable this material might be -- the bottom line being that if time is indeed precious, these six episodes finally feel too much like a waste of it."
11.22.63,0,No one would figure going back in time to spare the life of JFK would be easy or quick. But does it have to drag on so long and be this tiresome to watch?
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,0,"The final season was a chance for the show to engage in some systemic critique; its attempts to do so, however, largely fell flat... A soft-pedaled version of policing and the people who do it."
Arrested Development,0,"But resurrecting all of the previous season's complicated plotlines in one episode comes with its own consequences. Check your lease, Netflixers, because you're living in Flashback City."
Loot,0,"While it has plenty of funny moments, it’s a hard pill to swallow to muster much sympathy for a character that literally has everything she wants."
11.22.63,0,"11.22.63 is just here to entertain. And that's fine! But if the series wanted us to look past some truly awful things Jake does in the name of changing the past, it should've clarified what it wanted us to think of its protagonist."
The Good Wife,0,"The finale was littered with non-conclusions, contradictions and plain old absurdities."
The Essex Serpent,0,This “Serpent” slithers away without leaving much of an impact.
The Gilded Age,0,We know who these people are. They're clichés -- not unpleasant but wholly unsurprising.
Two and a Half Men,0,Was that the sound of a piano crashing down on the hopes and dreams of 10 million fans?
Amazing Stories,0,"Some twists, mystery in tame but lackluster anthology."
The Crown,0,"Sadly, what we get here from the Peter Morgan-created series is substantially tweaked timelines and substandard soap that is far less ""character"" and more live-action spitting image caricature."
The Office,0,"The Office has seemed lost, particularly by devoting substantial time to world-building Dwight's beet farm, a remnant of a failed spin-off effort."
Sex/Life,0,"Sex/Life drowns itself in the shallow end, so to speak, by failing to even generate much heat. There are plenty of R-rated scenes-so many, actually, that they get repetitive."
Waco,0,"The only way the government could look any more like buffoons, barbarians, and jackasses in the series is if the ATF and FBI sequences were soundtracked with ""Yakety Sax."""
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,It's much better paced and way easier to watch. But coming back from what was a truly lack-luster first season... was going to take a complete overhaul of the series and it's hard to say if that was ever going to be possible.
Inventing Anna,0,"It’s a Sisyphean task to get us to care as much about the writing of an article as the escapades of the person being written about, and neither the series nor a surprisingly depthless Chlumsky succeeds in doing so."
Bridgerton,0,"The show tries to tack on more substantive themes, while still ignoring the ways that its world-building has come up short."
The Nevers,0,This weird mix of space and steampunk will confuse viewers rather than confound them.
The Nevers,0,"The world-building, at least, is extensive, and it's possible later episodes might benefit from having carved out so much narrative real estate, so many competing interests. But these early episodes are crowded."
The First Lady,0,"Unfortunately, the Showtime drama mostly serves to reinforce existing historical caricatures, and while it doesn’t exactly waste the talents of Viola Davis, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Gillian Anderson, it certainly misuses them."
Night Sky,0,"Despite strong performances by Simmons and Spacek, this series just plods along with only mildly entertaining bits of story."
Treadstone,0,"A show whose ambition to try to capture a world's worth of adventure seems, too often, like taking the easy way out from digging too deeply into story or character."
Entourage,0,"Once fizzy and stuffed with A-list cameos, Entourage ends on a flat note and with a recurring role for Andrew Dice Clay."
The Beatles: Get Back,0,"Is it incredible and fascinating to witness the footage in Peter Jackson's ""The Beatles: Get Back"" doc-series? Hell, yes. Is it fascinating to watch the unfocused, directionless 6-hour-plus version of this meandering documentary? Not, really."
Joe vs Carole,0,"Kate McKinnon and John Cameron Mitchell give it their best in a series that offers too little, too late."
Twin Peaks,0,"I'm a fan of TV that breaks the rules. But for me, there are minimum requirements for coherence. And Twin Peaks is self-indulgently messing with viewers."
We Own This City,0,"The shows talented cast and shocking plot compel, but its dry factual narrative and blind-spot-heavy examination of policing make for an ultimately unsatisfying viewing experience."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,Why borrow a classic if you're not going to do anything with it?
Midnight Mass,0,The final scene was so nauseatingly mawkish I had to hide behind the sofa screaming to be put out of my misery.
The Wilds,0,"Overall, The Wilds is a letdown. There are some wonderful moments featuring the girls throughout the 8 episodes, but mainly you mainly just find yourself wishing the whole thing was done differently."
The Act,0,Watch Mommy Dead and Dearest as well as the various interviews with Gypsy Rose Blanchard instead; they'll be a lot more fascinating to watch than The Act.
Altered Carbon,0,"The ideas behind the premise are so good, the potential to examine existential issues about identity and humanity and how they're tied up in our physical form are so great, that it's frustrating to see how often the show takes a too-shallow approach."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Ultimately though, while White Lotus and Succession have proven we can never get enough of the wealthy behaving badly, your enjoyment of Strangers will come down to your tolerance for Kidman's seemingly merciless and mercurial Masha."
Lovecraft Country,0,"Generally, television shows are better served by declining to handhold their audiences through various twists and turns. But Lovecraft moves straight past 'trust the audience' and runs right into 'the audience can read our minds.'"
The Pentaverate,0,"It appears Myers learned nothing in the past 14 years, and The Pentaverate is as big a dud as he’s ever made."
Defending Jacob,0,"Part legal thriller, part whodunnit, the eight-part series stars an A-list cast, adheres to familiar crime genre convention and steps so carefully toward the finale reveal that it often feels more sleepy than suspenseful."
The X-Files,0,"I'm glad Gillian Anderson isn't coming back for next season because if this is the direction the show is taking us, it's time for it to end."
Shameless,0,Shameless fails many of its other characters when it comes to their conclusions. The series even does it in such a way where it feels like the show made a deliberate choice to avoid giving a solid ending to anyone's arc.
Squid Game,0,"The greater anticapitalist critique of Squid Game almost entirely toothless following any serious analysis...I am unimpressed with the messaging, and am confident this drama won't stand the test of time."
House of Cards,0,"The story picks up on the 4th of July, but it hardly feels like a birthday party with so much repetitive plotting and counterplotting going on."
And Just Like That...,0,SATC worked so well because it confidently introduced viewers to trends and fashions. Now its characters are out of touch and trying to play catch up; it's just not as interesting to watch.
Amazing Stories,0,"This show should have been a home run. In my opinion the missed opportunity lies in three areas: the story, the pacing and the direction."
Sex/Life,0,Dig a little deeper and you'll find a very naked truth: Sex/Life is nothing more than a series of dimly-lit sex scenes propped up by groan-inducing dialogue.
A Wilderness of Error,0,"A Wilderness of Error is a fascinating and informative look at a notorious piece of American history, but it struggles to defend its own relevance."
Sex/Life,0,A Road Runner cartoon has more sophisticated characterisations.
The Boondocks,0,The thrill is gone.
They Call Me Magic,0,"Earvin “Magic” Johnson is the cream, the best, on a level above the A list – but when there’s such an overwhelming winner, there’s no sport."
Black Mirror,0,The fifth season of Black Mirror isn't necessary bad -- each episode has a glimmer of something exciting -- but unfortunately that didn't quite go far enough.
The Nevers,0,"A generous take on The Nevers is that it's a fin de siècle X-Men, or maybe a Victorian Watchmen. A less generous take is that it's a more expensive version of Fox's The Gifted, one made without any clear understanding of hour-long cable narrative rhythm."
Archive 81,0,"The final product exists more as a collection of ideas. As new wrinkles each raise a handful of fresh possibilities, Archive 81 rarely settles on how or where to best focus its attention."
The Mist,0,"The series... plays around with elements familiar to members of King's devoted fan base, as well as those from Frank Darabont's intense and somber 2007 feature film of the same name, but with less successful results."
The Fall,0,"If Season 3 is the last season of Netflix's The Fall, it went out on a strange note."
Godless,0,I was excited for it... I think I fell asleep within the first 10 minutes of it. It was so unbelievably boring.
Bel-Air,0,"Once upon a time, Will from west Philly was miles from home, but the show he was in knew exactly what it was and where it was going. Bel-Air finds that a difficult trick to replicate."
1883,0,"For fans of westerns, 1883 certainly looks like the real deal, coming from Yellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan and featuring Sam Elliott as a gnarled cowboy. The execution, however, feels stale."
The Wheel of Time,0,Will The Wheel of Time be a hit? Don't ask me. All I know is that I went into a kind of death spiral after watching the first episode.
Castle Rock,0,"In this misguided series, the clash between grounded psychological horror and bump-in-the-night monster mania delivers fewer shivers than shrugs of confusion."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"Hollow characters, an uncertain tone and, most damningly, a total lack of chemistry keep The Time Traveler’s Wife from ever quite rising to the level of swoon-worthy."
The Pentaverate,0,A profoundly unfunny series of sex and poop jokes.
The First,0,"The First begins as a space exploration drama on its way to Mars, but the show, like the mission it depicts, never quite lifts off the ground."
The OA,0,"The willing suspension of disbelief has to be earned, and from where I'm standing, The OA doesn't earn it."
And Just Like That...,0,"To say I was disappointed with where we ended up is something of an understatement. However, theres a spark of promise in some of these storylines, and if we get Season 2, its possible that the series could improve. Or maybe Im deluded."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,Adam McKay and John C Reilly join forces for a look back at the rise of the Lakers but strong performances can’t quite paper over a messy structure.
The Baby,0,The best thing about HBO’s eight-part British horror comedy The Baby is that it rarely exceeds thirty minutes per episode. The worst thing about The Baby is that it’s a TV series at all.
Inventing Anna,0,"If Inventing Anna possesses any relevance at all, its due to the quality of its cast."
Marvel's Agent Carter,0,"Get past the surface, though, and it once again looks as if the show has been relegated to the role of little more than handsome placeholder to break up SHIELD's season - all dressed up, perhaps, but as outfitted, with no real place to go."
Entourage,0,We shall see if the boys become men by the end of this eight-episode season. But I doubt it; they're talking movies now.
Sex/Life,0,The eight-episode season easily could’ve been boiled down into two TikToks...
Monsters at Work,0,An unremarkable journey through ideas we've already seen done better before.
Slow Horses,0,"Even at six episodesmost of which are around 40 minutes longthe show feels like its going around in circles, dragging you by the hand along with it. And a lot of it requires massive leaps of logic."
WandaVision,0,"The classic-comedy pastiche is skillful, affectionate and well-performed, but it's not terribly imaginative - if anything, it's a little too true to its antiquated sources. It's also not very funny."
The Offer,0,"At 10 hours, the material is stretched absurdly thin, and it makes every flaw show."
The Undoing,0,"While beautiful to look at, the show struggles to say something compelling as it's more interested in amplifying the melodrama instead of delving deep into its more interesting subjects."
Invincible,0,"But both the jokes and the character beats that fuel Invincible are too sporadic to make the series feel anything more than sputtering. Unassailable, it is not."
The Stand,0,"This adaptation, which starts off succinctly, starts to strain as soon as it has to shoulder the biblical proportions. ""The Stand"" works better as a study in survivalist pluck than as a theological thunderdome."
The Wheel of Time,0,"Early on, the wanderers take refuge in a cursed city, its deserted streets lined with baroque architecture and statuary. ""Wheel,"" as a production, feels like that. It's a breathtakingly detailed edifice with no people in it."
Boardwalk Empire,0,"For its final season, the show seems to want to bring the focus back onto Nucky, but as usual there's no particularly compelling reason to care about what happens to him."
The Undoing,0,"While The Undoing strings together just enough surprises to keep viewers interested episode-to-episode, its writing and direction are both muddled, making for an occasionally unpleasant viewing experience."
Lisey's Story,0,An eight-episode gluepot.
The Stand,0,"In 2021, when there's more content out there than any but the shut-in or chronically unemployed can hope to consume, being ignored - as The Stand deserves to be - is perhaps the unkindest fate of all."
Sex/Life,0,"That ""High Impact Sex Scenes"" content warning strikes me as blatant false adverting."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"I wish the series had more of a clear idea of what its genre was, other than crazy and trippy. Nine Perfect Strangers is at its best when Bobby Cannavale and Melissa McCarthy are allowed to display all of their comedic aptitude on screen."
The Stand,0,"The Stand is a shockingly inept adaptation of Stephen King's most beloved properties. Nearly every creative choice is bad - from bland characters, to stilted dialogue, to glacial pacing. It's just so boring."
Inventing Anna,0,Inventing Anna feels like a ghost of a shadow of its central narrative. What’s left is a show that is so obsessed with the idea of its main character that it forgets to explore who that young woman is.
13 Reasons Why,0,"The show's myopia isn't surprising. If anything, the final season proves once again that teen viewers deserved better than what 13 Reasons Why offered, and if the show is remembered in a few years, it'll be mostly for what it failed to do."
The Stranger,0,"'The Stranger' is an effective and addictive thriller, but despite its overabundance of elements, it is incredibly meaningless. [Full Review in Spanish]"
The Mosquito Coast,0,"The show's skittish unwillingness to look hard at its characters for longer than a monologue dooms it -- not to failure but to a sort of absence, making a show about people in the fight for their lives feel like something to have on in the background."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,0,"Any attempt to reboot The Mighty Ducks shouldn't be undertaken lightly. The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers, unfortunately, tackles the franchise with all the grace and nuance of the Bash Brothers."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"The premise sounds so simple and fruitful. But despite all the talent involved, the result is confusing, landing in a no-man's-land between comedy, drama and thriller."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Nine Perfect Strangers, in contrast to the strengths and limitations of [White] Lotus, tastes bland and feels tonally indistinct."
We Own This City,0,"We Own wanted to be a thundering state-of-the-nation address on race and policing, but forgot that it also had to be interesting."
The Crown,0,The show seriously falters with Diana... The Crown prides itself on verisimilitude and that starts to fall away in Season 4.
The Mosquito Coast,0,"A lot of bleeding-heart sentiments are expressed in a show where a white family traverse the hostile, corpse-ridden landscape from the US to Mexico like tourists in other people's suffering."
Dark,0,"For a series that thrives in its complexity, it's disappointing."
WeCrashed,0,"Boy howdy if it doesn’t match former WeWork CEO Adam Neumann pound-for-pound on crappy decision-making, hapless showmanship, and missed opportunities to get back to basics."
Safe,0,It's a thriller by numbers that doesn't feel clever enough for its talented cast.
The Sopranos,0,"To me, it felt like an hourlong f--- you from a guy who has seen fan devotion for The Sopranos transform him from a little-known but well respected TV producer into one of the most legendary TV auteurs in history."
Normal People,0,"I kept yearning for these mouthwateringly beautiful people to be more convincingly nasty to each other, for the romance to take on palpable energy, fizz, danger, real sadness."
True Blood,0,Although the series could have continued - maybe by introducing zombies or mummies - True Blood had nowhere to go but in circles. It was time to put a stake in it.
Pretty Little Liars,0,"In its seventh season, Pretty Little Liars illustrates the dangers of stretching a mystery as far as it can go with a splashy premiere that fails to establish real stakes for its characters."
Y: The Last Man,0,Eliza Clark took over after the initial showrunners departed. She gamely tries to expand the story's ensemble... but there's a basic lack of flair in the storytelling.
Sex and the City,0,"By the time the show had ended its run on HBO, it was already like putting lipstick on a corpse; the flesh was willing, albeit a bit withered, but the spirit has long departed. Not that there ever was much soul to begin with."
Bridgerton,0,"82 million Netflix account holders can’t be wrong, can they? Well, yes. Yes, they can."
The Haunting of Hill House,0,"Things were going so well. Now here I am, out back in the cold of night, burying it."
They Call Me Magic,0,"No disrespect to Magic Johnson on or off the court, but this very authorized love-in lacks the stakes or the drama of the Michael Jordan docuseries, The Last Dance."
11.22.63,0,"If Stephen King could go back in time, maybe he'd decide to stop selling his books to television."
Peacemaker,0,Despite the near-bottomless charm of star John Cena... Peacemaker is ultimately more of a flimsy throat-clearing than a show with anything to say.
WandaVision,0,"The first three-ish episodes were very fun, and then it pretty quickly turned into a long Marvel movie."
How I Met Your Mother,0,"""Last Forever"" brought up the idea of true love versus soul mates, and a bit about fate, but if I wanted to watch a series about how your soulmate might not be the love of your life, I'd have watched Dawson's Creek, a series which did it much better."
And Just Like That...,0,"Why is everyone so dulled down? This brings us to Samantha, whose absence may be the biggest presence on And Just Like That so far. There is no good way to write her out."
The Beatles: Get Back,0,"Like the Beatles themselves, by the time the final episode drags itself to a close, viewers are likely to be ready, finally, to quit."
Treadstone,0,It's all a clone of the same idea. [Full Review in Spanish]
Marvel's Agent Carter,0,"You wouldn't be alone in feeling that this season of Agent Carter lacked a certain urgency...that's really the rub, that Season 2 never seemed like it had enough to say on Peggy's journey..."
Moon Knight,0,"The newest MCU series on Disney+ has some interesting ideas and cool authentically Egyptian flavor, but takes its own little time to get rolling."
The First Lady,0,"Once the “great woman behind the man” story line emerges as the show’s primary theme, “The First Lady” cannot help but seem hopelessly old-fashioned — and ill-timed for what already seems like a regressive moment for women in our nation."
The Lincoln Lawyer,0,It’s Netflix’s version of the sort of retro TNT drama that I only know exists because I left my television on after an NBA game...
Bel-Air,0,"It has many of the familiar tropes of 21st-century teen drama, and none is used to particularly gripping effect: the petty sexual jealousies and earnest melodrama quickly start to grate."
The White Lotus,0,"If you like rich, self-absorbed bores whining and wittering among themselves, fantastic."
The White Lotus,0,"The trollish timing of the show's premise, that vacations are wasted on those who least need it, certainly deserves some grudging admiration. But a swerve late in the series disappointingly sails the story toward calmer waters."
God's Favorite Idiot,0,"Falcone’s heart is clearly in the right place, but all his goodwill is undone by a narrative that is both too simple and overly convoluted, underdeveloped characters, and chintzy production design."
Brave New World,0,"Both Brown Findlay and Ehrenreich seem frustratingly tamped-down here... No wonder the actors seem exhausted; their project, deep into its first season, doesn't know what kind of show it wants to be."
Glee,0,Perhaps Ryan Murphy's most ruinous decision was to go all-out in his embrace of victimhood.
Halo,0,I can safely say that the major flaw in this series is not the lack of accuracy or loyalty to the source material (though that certainly hurt it) but it is the lack of heart in the series.
And Just Like That...,0,"The reboot's hour-long episodes do not suit the material like the original's breezy, half-hour episodes. Here, there's more space between jokes and more space still between funny ones."
Sex/Life,0,"Sex/Life is billed as comedy drama. If it's funny, though, it's for all the wrong reasons."
The Mandalorian,0,"Where some will be down for the expansion of this story into the larger connected universe, plenty will morn the loss of what was the most unique piece of the on-screen Star Wars universe to date."
Monsters at Work,0,It feels like a long wait at times. The first two half-hour episodes (the only ones of the 10 that were available for review) are extraordinarily slow.
Sex/Life,0,"The primary failing of Sex/Life is its inability to balance the acrobatic-romp and woman-finding-herself elements of its concept; there's so much of the former, and not enough of the latter."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"""The Mosquito Coast"" works best when you just follow along with the running and don't think too hard about the rest, but the running itself becomes tedious after awhile. Not everything makes perfect sense, or seems remotely plausible."
Tokyo Vice,0,"In an overabundant genre where story lines tend to follow the familiar beats of an investigation, viewers have to care about the hero. And that’s tough when his inner life is given minimal attention."
13 Reasons Why,0,This show has no business being a full hour long. And it certainly has no business leaving us with an hour-and-36-minute (!) series finale.
Loot,0,"The Apple TV+ series has a concept and a star that practically commands you to pay attention, but the show fails to build on its foundation and is an imperfect showcase for Rudolph’s talents."
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,"Some of these scenes are watchable, good even - but they kill the pace during the series' already-flabby hour-long episodes, and leave you longing for a simpler story without the padding."
The Nevers,0,To paraphrase Coco Chanel: This is a TV show that should look in the mirror and take off one plot point before exiting the house.
The Mysterious Benedict Society,0,"There could be potential here, but not enough to build real enthusiasm."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,Not since Bohemian Rhapsody have we seen scenes so poorly edited.
Severance,0,"If the series wants to tackle the exploitation of labor, even in its own exaggerated way, it usually helps when the authoritarians' methods of oppression make sense—logically and emotionally..."
Lisey's Story,0,"Lisey's Story is, on all fronts, too much. Too long, too over-produced, too many talents, too overwrought, too much going on."
The Book of Boba Fett,0,"While the series starts strong by leaning on star Temuera Morrison's strong ability and his connection to ingenious storylines, the show ultimately feels more compelled to set up the Star Wars expanded universe then telling a coherent narrative."
The Thing About Pam,0,Zellweger is simultaneously broadly cartoonish and blandly nonspecific. She squints so much that her eyes lose whatever interiority they might have reflected; there is no real difference between her smile or her frown.
Bel-Air,0,"The scriptwriting has to be superb, and too often here, things fall flat -- plot lines are too predictable, character motivations are slightly questionable, and the dialogue can be a bit too expositional."
Once Upon a Time,0,OUAT season seven suffers from the same anvil-ish dialogue it always has.
The Pentaverate,0,"The Pentaverate rambles and repeats itself too often, even if the glimpses of Myers’ undeniable skill almost make it work and might be just enough for those who have missed him so."
House of Cards,0,I doubt that I was the only one whose own lethargy gave her cause for revulsion.
Star Trek: Picard,0,"While it starts strong, and it's focus on recontextualizing trauma remains earnestly admirable, the season ultimately doesn't have enough story to propel its 10-hour runtime, leading to meandering plots that rely more on nostalgia then storytelling."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,0,"Dull and talky, with flashes of promise."
Severance,0,Ben Stiller's horror series Severance asks interesting questions but gets lost in giving the answers.
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Kidman has the range to play both the unicorn and the woman, but nobody bothered to give her the more important part of that equation."
Taboo,0,"... if you have ever wished to know what you get when too many alpha males gather in a room, perhaps this is it."
Peacemaker,0,"With Cenas undeniable charisma and a cast willing to play along with every insane scenario, theres quality moments. Its too bad that Gunn kept forcing chaos on a team and a series that would have benefited from a bit less ofwell, everything."
Lisey's Story,0,"It's disappointing given the top-tier cast and production team. The three brilliant female leads are mostly weeping, catatonic or angry and confused, which is relatable to those of us struggling to keep up with the narrative."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"The adaptation is so lazy that episodes begin with the lead characters reading lines straight into the camera, rather than anyone making the effort to work them into the script."
And Just Like That...,0,The show feels like it's trying to reverse-engineer itself through a lot of virtue signaling...
Angelyne,0,I liked “Angelyne” better as it went on... without ever being wholly convinced that it was a trip I needed to take.
Jersey Shore,0,"Just because the Jersey Shore era has come to a close, let's not pump it up with either instant nostalgia or importance."
Brave New World,0,"This adaptation looks great but is definitively hollow, and in turn all of its parties, extensive discussions, and choreographed orgy scenes become simply exhausting."
Schmigadoon!,0,"After having borrowed quite so heavily from traditional forms, the show only haltingly and gradually, and without much of the help that the neglected Key and Strong might have provided, arrives at something that can stand on its own."
Station Eleven,0,"In the end, ""Station Eleven"" may be too attached to its rose-colored glasses."
The Nevers,0,"This potentially provocative, supernatural sci-fi series is unfocused and uneven."
And Just Like That...,0,"And Just Like That... A New Chapter of Sex and the City is a clumsy, cringe-inducing revival that fails to recapture the magic of the original."
Big Little Lies,0,"I admire restraint, and I can appreciate a destabilizing ending. But in season two, it felt as if Big Little Lies was missing whole pieces of narrative cohesion."
Safe,0,Safe isn't without its ticking clock grittiness and compelling riddles but there's also unintended comedy involved with a story where everyone somehow unwittingly contributes to someone's dire demise.
Bodyguard,0,"Unfortunately, full of filler where there should be thriller, Bodyguard just can't get the job done, literally or figuratively."
Halo,0,I dont see much in these early episodes to make investing in a full season worthwhile. Halo does not come remotely close to any of the other sci-fi or fantasy series out there and represents yet another mediocre video game adaptation.
Moon Knight,0,"While certainly Oscar Issacs, as well as the emotional and accurate depiction of DID, manage to spice the series up a tiny bit, Moon Knight ultimately proves too adherent to the MCU's storytelling checkboxes to feel worthwhile."
Halo,0,The frustrating thing about Halo is that it tries to serve two masters -- diehard Halo fans and newbies who are used to the normal rhythms of sci-fi streaming series -- and doesn’t quite please either.
Raised by Wolves,0,"It’s a lot. A lot of weirdness that instead of being fed to us as mysteries for us to theorize about, or as simple pieces of a puzzle, they instead become seeds for further mystery-box tropes."
The Staircase,0,"True crime is not something to be toyed with, and The Staircase, for all the beautiful work put into it, toys with viewers instead of finding the salient truths about the case."
The Afterparty,0,"An Apple TV+ comedy series with one murder, plenty of suspects and minimal intrigue -- the sort of show that's modestly entertaining but doesn't bring enough to the party."
Tokyo Vice,0,It all feels as dated as Miami Vice's fashion sense.
Modern Family,0,"The show should've ended years ago, when it was better equipped to tie together all these subplots, characters, and themes. Now, we're left with an ending that doesn't really want to be an ending."
The Nevers,0,"The show is being pulled in two different directions... If only we could agree to retcon the wayward sci-fi part of the story, HBO would have the best new prestige fantasy series on television. As it stands, it's likely to only get worse."
Pieces of Her,0,Pieces Of Her takes forever to come together.
Lost,0,Does this mean all of Lost counts for nothing? It's another question I can't answer.
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"If you are one of the approximately six people who didn't groan at the first season of this plodding, dull headache of a property, good news: You will also not hate the second one."
Godless,0,"Jeff Daniels and Michelle Dockery seeking new sorts of roles is admirable, but the results need a bit of tweaking."
Lisey's Story,0,"The series is ultimately a cautionary example of what can go wrong with the creative process when a megabucks patron such as Apple says ""yes"" to everyone."
Roar,0,"While stylish and provocative, the series ultimately falls a little flat in its message. If a woman’s plight is to suffer, then Roar doesn’t end up giving its women a way out."
Inventing Anna,0,A dull spin on an otherwise captivating story...
True Detective,0,"True Detective bills itself as something better, but really, it's just more of the same."
Lisey's Story,0,"Lisey's Story has a strong cast and direction, but the writing ultimately sinks the series."
The End of the F...ing World,0,"Forcing more drama onto them after they've left only feels forced. It's a lose-lose scenario, and while I'll always contend there's a good way to keep telling many stories, this isn't it."
Star Trek: Voyager,0,Voyager reigns as the most infuriating and creatively haphazard Star Trek series for how it squandered such a great premise.
Foundation,0,"Not much about Foundation sticks, either emotionally or narratively. There are cause-and-effect relationships between one event and another, but they're stretched across long-attenuated frames."
A Wilderness of Error,0,"""A Wilderness of Error"" offers a not-so-illuminating message that it's sometimes difficult to get at the truth that's not worth the five hours it takes to hear it."
This Way Up,0,"Lame gags come thick and fast. But, in an all-too-convenient cop-out, we're frequently reminded that cracking lame gags is a crucial aspect of the protagonists' coping techniques."
Brave New World,0,"Welcome to this not-so Brave New World, where all the ideas feel old and not nearly as deeply considered as the creators think. But, hey, at least it all looks fabulous."
Limitless,0,"It's not heavy-handed and it doesn't dumb down its audience (although you do have to buy into the NZT brainpower stuff), it just feels like it's missing something, and I think that something may be a level of investment in the characters."
The Afterparty,0,"If this is the future of television, pass me the bottle."
The Righteous Gemstones,0,"Season two of ""The Righteous Gemstones"" is an ambitious, intermittently hysterical mess. McBride and Hill attempt to expand the show outward, often into full-on action set pieces that, while impressive, fail to find cohesion with the rest of the series."
The X-Files,0,"Based on five episodes made available for preview, things remain uneven -- the first episode is dragged down by more conspiracy blather, interminable voiceover and way too many apocalyptic predictions of doom."
Little America,0,"It's the best show Apple has produced so far, but it's also the most misguided. It almost hurts, considering the talent behind Little America."
Coyote,0,"Breaking Bad director Michelle MacLaren gives this series a ""Bad"" vibe, but that doesn't insure it is good... Coyote proves watchable but too derivative."
The Morning Show,0,"It wants us to be content to marvel at its framework of aspiration and drive, along with loving its two co-stars. After a point, though, the performances aren't enough of a reason to continue ignoring the story's lack of substance, guts and a soul."
Bridgerton,0,Bridgerton season 2 is a lackluster season that hopes to recapture the heights of its first but mostly falls short.
Foundation,0,The show's starry-eyed ambitions are dulled by its execution. Its scattered focus stalls momentum by introducing and discarding characters like a wad of receipts found in your back pocket after a night on the town.
And Just Like That...,0,A sequel that was dead on arrival...
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,0,"For a series dedicated to supposed historical realism, Downton Abbey wraps things up with a bow of pure fantasy."
Lost,0,Like the televisual equivalent of a keyboard-pounding poet... At least we know that we'll only have to suffer through one more season of this foolishness.
Amazing Stories,0,When this ending comes the audience may wish they'd have watched something more exciting instead.
The Pentaverate,0,"Returning to the prosthetics and puns that helped make Austin Powers a classic was an inherent risk, but it might have been worth it with better writing."
Foundation,0,"Foundation has no evident limitations of any kind, yet no real visceral impact for the most part, because it's almost stultifyingly dull, especially in its middle episodes."
Brave New World,0,"The constant writhing of beautiful bodies isn't enough to keep the interest in a show with a plotline as thin as ice. Lazy writing with no engaging qualities leaves this one, one tough pill to swallow."
Suspicion,0,"The cast is appealing, but Thurman lacks energy to the point where she seems almost glazed."
The Wheel of Time,0,"There are worse fantasy series and films out there, to be sure, but none of them were dumb enough to give their monsters a name that rhymes with ""bollocks""."
MacGruber,0,"It's hard to get excited for a sequel to a film that wasn't very good to begin with, especially when the sequel is three times as long."
Community,0,"Diehard fans will probably still find much to enjoy, but I'm inclined to think it's time for everybody to graduate from Greendale Community College, and get on with their lives."
Looking for Alaska,0,"This is all pretty stiff, predictable stuff, built around the operatic pangs of teen romance."
Schmigadoon!,0,"Strong appears genuinely entertained and can hold a lovely note alongside the rest of the stage-ready cast. Still, neither the writing nor direction take advantage of the skills that Strong has honed throughout her time on Saturday Night Live."
The Offer,0,"There's some good and bad with this... but at a certain point, you think ""Why am I watching a miniseries about The Godfather when I could be watching The Godfather?"""
Invasion,0,Invasion is an admirable attempt at subverting the expectations that come with a big budget sci-fi show about alien invaders; the only problem is that it's not very interesting or exciting.
Sons of Anarchy,0,"While it will be interesting to see the way Sons tackles loose ends, in terms of how the series explores shades of gray, it looks like it's all over but the shooting."
The First,0,The First is never quite able to blast off.
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,"Although '80s-style excess clearly accounts for much of the sizzle, this exercise feels like a no-look pass that skips out of bounds."
What If...?,0,"While my curiosity is piqued, I wasn't completely blown away by this outing."
Chloe,0,"Perhaps the idea was to evoke the haunting effects of memory and loss which can never be completely resolved, but it felt like a deflating end to a drama which promised much more."
The Fall,0,"This show thinks it is Very Important Viewing, unmissable drama, televisual literature. The fact is it's very missable indeed."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"Ultimately, the first season feels a bit like a walkway to the real story -- or, more accurately, a runway. It's a lot of busy preamble."
Bridgerton,0,"Bridgerton Season 2 tries hard to please everyone, but ends up feeling watered down."
Pieces of Her,0,"Collete is as watchable as always; she deserves better than this, though."
Arrested Development,0,"The meandering plot sucks the charm from everything. The characters feel oddly as though they don't get to exhibit or develop the traits we know them by, as they're usually too busy rattling off exposition."
Coyote,0,"""Coyote"" may find its way to more substance if it's allowed to prowl a bit longer, but like Ben's bowel movements, you're just as likely to be relieved that it's over."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Is this an erotic thriller? A courtroom drama? An expose of social issues? At times it is all of these things, though most of the time it exists in the listless space between any clear genre -- or sense of identity."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"Ultimately, the story doesn't really matter because the characters are paper thin, and efforts to make Alice more than a damsel in distress -- she's a skull-crushing, tree climber -- don't really add much depth."
Mr. Robot,0,"At this moment in time, however, Mr Robot seems just as likely to spend its final episodes chasing its tail."
The Endgame,0,"We’ve been down this road before, but at least this one is paved in Baccarin’s dark lipstick and wry, self-assured grins."
And Just Like That...,0,Ask not whether fans needed this reboot but why Parker and King wanted to go to all this trouble in the first place.
Invasion,0,"""Invasion"" always feels like it's using each far-flung story as a checklist."
The Office,0,"And so NBC's The Office takes its leave, after overstaying its welcome and most often erring on the side of over-worked sentiment rather than pure comedy."
Inventing Anna,0,"It’s too much that adds to too little. There is a compelling story to tell here, but “Inventing Anna” isn’t it."
The X-Files,0,"And if you are not already a fan, there is no good reason to watch Season 11. The opening episode verged on soap opera, bloated with cringey dialogue and breathy conspiracies."
Reacher,0,"It spends eight episodes paving the way not to hell with its good intentions, but to mediocre television."
Ramy,0,"Even one great supporting performance, itself overcoming a relatively one-note character, doesn't make the season any less disappointing."
Wolf Like Me,0,"Wolf Like Me aims high, but ends up howling at the moon with some deeply implausible parental angst"
Midnight Mass,0,"Flanagan seems to have made a spiritual, contemplative turn in his life and writing. Good for him; not so good for those who liked his earliest stuff. I'm taking a pass on Mass."
Jericho,0,"Well the good news is that the show is kinda-sorta ratcheting up the focus on the ""what happened"" story, plus it's looking more into how the country as a whole is dealing with its post-nukey self. The bad news is, I totally don't care anymore. At all."
Brave New World,0,Brave New World plays it safe and rehearses empty criticisms that are undone by its own content and platform.
The Wonder Years,0,"The old show was escapist, sure, the new one is not, but the inevitable question is why a network remakes a show in a way that largely ignores the charms of the original."
The Umbrella Academy,0,"This is the most apocalyptic-y apocalypse ever, but it carries no real weight. Then when you find out what has to be done to save the universe, it just feels very underwhelming. Samurais, really?"
Amazing Stories,0,"It seems like this is another example of Apple having great star power, but not knowing how to use it."
House of Cards,0,"By the time the last three episodes roll around, House of Cards' final season has abruptly buried itself in a whole host of weird, borderline anti-feminist tropes."
X-Men,0,The fifth season isn't worth watching.
The Boondocks,0,"It's a zombie show, like the Dan Harmon-less fourth season of Community. Something's off. You can't figure out exactly what, but you can feel it."
Godless,0,"In Godless, we see a black town, literally called Blackdom, and its inhabitants as ""others..."" Think that's bad? Native American characters do not do better"
Rise,0,"The problem is, even with its many storylines, Rise's attempt at making the viewer a part of this small town's community, it is just too prescribed."
The Stand,0,"With its many subplots, some more compelling than others, it's an uneven series that's not so much a must-watch as a can-watch."
Friends,0,"Even the kiss that cemented Ross and Rachel couldn't disguise the show's larger anti-climax, a cop-out from the logical conclusions of the show's premise, conclusions it began to acknowledge only to ultimately deny their existence."
Squid Game,0,"Like Joker, there's a having-it-both-ways insistence that a culture that could create violence is inherently sick and deranged, while playing out a wildly overstated version of sick derangement in a manner designed to be maximally tense and amusing."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,0,"[It] feels like Stewart's attempt to evolve what he used to do for a new era. He just hasn't figured out how to do it yet, and may be too entrenched in his old approach to succeed for anyone beyond the most die-hard Daily Show With Jon Stewart fans."
WeCrashed,0,"This meaty showcase for Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway is wrapped in a somewhat malnourished limited series, with the misfortune of coming at the tail end of several better productions about high-stakes startups whose founders flew too close to the sun."
Turner & Hooch,0,"It's not very good, but I guess that means it's paying homage to the original."
Black Mirror,0,"Such dissonance underscores the impression, supported by the occasional but conspicuous Britishisms that issue from the mouths of American characters in the Netflix seasons, that Brooker isn't getting enough feedback on his scripts."
Schmigadoon!,0,"There's too much talent here for Schmigadoon! to ever be a total waste, but the show is far more pandering than nurturing."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"I'd watch these characters all day under the simplicity of a spotlight and a monologue, free from the pretentious packaging. It's a shame that the show seems to get hit with a tranquilizer dart after the first couple of episodes ..."
Altered Carbon,0,"For intriguing sci-fi action, stick with that strong first season. For the big questions, fellow Netflix original The Good Place is just a few short clicks away."
Foundation,0,"Its early episodes never quite reach that next level, or find the extra something special that made Asimov's work connect with so many for so long."
Monsters at Work,0,"Rather than lending fresh new eyes to a world first established two decades ago, Gannaway and company play a Greatest Hits montage of Monsters Inc. references."
They Call Me Magic,0,"It's a story that could easily have been told within the confines of a traditional 90 minutes (or less), but the style nowadays is to stretch out the form in order to make it an event."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,0,"The split timeline is a plague on TV, and its latest victim is Showtime’s The Man Who Fell to Earth."
Behind Her Eyes,0,"The empty characterization isn't egregious, but it seems like an apparatus that's been built around some hidden central engine the show doesn't want to reveal. Why are these people like this?"
Devs,0,"It's probably a Marmite drama, but in its preoccupation with being clever-clever and abstruse, it has made its characters too insipid and humourless to give a monkey's about."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,It really should be known for is pulling back the curtain on the way the superhero genre can encourage the worst in us.
Ozark,0,"More often than not, Ozarks double-crosses and shady dealings read like bullet points on a list the writers are running through, with no intrigue or connective tissue between them."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,I've wished for a show that rows against the current of TV trends that I've grown tired of. And my wish came true! I just should have been more specific and wished for a better show.
Pieces of Her,0,"Slick enough to keep a viewer from turning off Netflix’s autoplay feature, but too broad and detached to generate much in the way of insight or emotional connection, Pieces of Her struggles to locate a beating human heart at the center of its mystery."
Westworld,0,"The new season of often wayward drama doesn’t just treat many of the people onscreen as NPCs. Withholding to a fault and placing a wearying emphasis on misdirection, it leaves viewers in the dark."
Line of Duty,0,It all feels very much as if Line Of Duty is running out of energy and impetus. Six seasons is one too many.
Arrested Development,0,"Arrested Development, which was once, easily, one of my favorite comedies of all time, has become a reanimated corpse that I'd like to see dead and buried."
Roar,0,"Roar has built a daring experiment, bringing in a diverse group of female writing, directing, and acting heavyweights -- which makes the series almost fascinating in its failure to deliver."
Invasion,0,"Take away the aliens, and what's left is essentially the sprawling network family drama series This Is Us."
24,0,Is this a series too far?
The Undoing,0,"It's almost hard to believe that stars Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grant, series writer David E. Kelley and series director Susanne Bier could come up with a show so limp, so generic, so dispiritingly bad as this six-hour drama."
Turner & Hooch,0,"It leans much too hard into the corny aesthetic of those kinds of lighthearted dramas, creating something too silly and childish for most adults, yet likely too old-fashioned for their own children."
Battlestar Galactica,0,I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE YELLED AT A SHOW LIKE THIS. I WAS ROOTING FOR YOU. WE WERE ALL ROOTING FOR YOU! HOW DARE YOU!
Reacher,0,"Reacher hits all of the required beats of the story but never does it with a kinda of aplomb. There’s all the elements presented here, but there doesn’t seem to be much in the way of depth and the filmmaking leaves a lot to be desired."
True Blood,0,Someone should have put a stake in this show years ago.
Angelyne,0,Rarely makes for more than a fitfully engrossing watch.
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Nine Perfect Strangers suffers from the same chronic issue that so many television adaptations of juicy novels do: it fails to capture the sneaky, get-under-your-skin tendency of its engrossing source material."
The Nevers,0,The Nevers has a lot going for it but it's a distillation of Whedon's best and worst filmmaking impulses. It needs someone with a more disciplined eye to cut half of its many dangling threads and subplots.
Cardinal,0,The whole thing was so chilly that it left me craving a show that is the absolute opposite of this in every way: Death in Paradise.
Godless,0,"There are interesting ideas and some refreshing roles here, languorously trailed among the endless vistas. But these ideas flare and subside in the slow sprawl of the show, without the assurance of a guiding hand."
Prison Break,0,"Once the thrill of becoming reacquainted wears off, you're left with a somewhat muddled, not at all credible yarn."
The Mosquito Coast,0,Even [Justin Theroux's] absorbing performance can't make Mosquito Coast make sense.
First Kill,0,"It's not a good show, but it does have a good message: Love is love. Netflix is releasing this during Pride Month for a reason."
Invasion,0,Invasion proceeds so incrementally across such a wide range of characters and their responses to extraterrestrial terrorism that you might well lose your way from week to week. Never mind your interest.
The Boys,0,"Three seasons in, the gag is starting to grow a bit old, as the satire gets weaker and more toothless and more characters vie for our attention while traveling down familiar roads."
True Detective,0,"The new True Detective is faintly pretentious, manageably ridiculous, and dull."
Alias Grace,0,"It's mostly restrained and respectable, with modest production values and uneven performances."
Game of Thrones,0,"It's such a fundamental shift of priorities that, for all of season 8's technical virtues and the sound resolution of a few story beats, it still can't help but feel like a betrayal of the show's ethos"
The Right Stuff,0,"Approach it simply as Hunky Young Astronauts in Love rather than a Wolfe adaptation... like the movie, it still can't find time to dedicate a full episode to NASA's test monkeys - and you might even be able to dispense with some of the disappointment."
Brave New World,0,"Miniseries that scratches on Aldous Huxley's novel, staying on the surface. [Full review in Spanish]"
Star Wars Resistance,0,"The bottom line is that Resistance... isn't really that good, or memorable. More specifically, it's a show that really doesn't know what it wants to be."
Gaslit,0,"Roberts simply feels miscast as Martha, to whom she bears no resemblance, physical or otherwise."
Lovecraft Country,0,"The show inadvertently simplifies the realities of white supremacy with its monster allegory, while treating the Black cast less as characters in their own right and more as vehicles for a sweeping critique of American racism."
Elite,0,"By its new fifth season, Élite finally arrives at the point where it can no longer pull off its gimmicks."
The Morning Show,0,"There are too many people on this show, and without exactly being sure what the series' point is, there's no way for the writers to know who to focus on. But I just know it shouldn't be the men."
The Wilds,0,"The end result is a season that is overstuffed and yet drags, as though the boys sucked all the energy out of the first season, as they do."
True Detective,0,"Ali's performance is an example of what the show can be, but the third season as a whole remains as a disappointing reminder of what was."
Glee,0,"Although it's taken a step in the right direction, the show's previous ubiquity in high school pop culture leaves it as a pale imitation of its former self in the sixth and final season's two-hour premiere."
The Morning Show,0,The Morning Show once again fails to provide its stellar cast with compelling storylines or complex character development.
Killing Eve,0,"Instead of something small but perfectly formed, Killing Eve has become one of those programmes that seems mainly to inspire the response, “Oh are they still making that?”"
Mr. Corman,0,I wonder with Joseph Gordon-Levitt wearing too many creative hats that he's juggling too many ideas both with the storytelling and the creative vision to keep up emotional drive within the series.
Lisey's Story,0,This show is hellbent on driving me mad thanks to one of its biggest stumbling blocks: the absence of any sort of logic to this universe.
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,Iron Fist's sophomore season isn't able to right the many wrongs from its first. Don't waste your time on this one.
Loot,0,"The talented cast, glossy production sheen, and pop culture savvy jokes make the ten 30-minute episodes an easy watch. Unfortunately, Loot can’t stop the glimmer from fading."
After Life,0,It's a season that betrays its own legacy and destroys the absolute brilliance of the first season.
The Mist,0,"Okay, it's possible I'm overreacting here just a smidge. But Spike's version of The Mist is one dumb piece of work."
Schmigadoon!,0,"Like so many quality control-lacking project with Lorne Michaels as an executive producer, this series... is an SNL skit in search of a story."
Limitless,0,"With this new series, CBS seems to have squandered the potential of a weird, compelling premise by cramming it into an average procedural crime-show mold."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,"Winning Time is guaranteed to turn the stomachs of not only Boston Celtics fans, but anyone hoping for more than an egregiously cartoonish and ham-fisted hagiography executed with all the subtlety of a no-look pass."
The Outsider,0,"It's refreshing for film and TV producers to take King's work as seriously as his readers do, but The Outsider proves that the solemn approach can go too far."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"Towards the end there was a 50-50 split between good and bad, but the first half or the show there was barely anything to like. A sad end for the Netflix MCU branch."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"I had the same uneasy reaction to the podcast itself, and I bailed on Shrink early, in both incarnations. But hey, there's obviously an audience for this."
Sex/Life,0,"Explicitness abounds. However, the friction that Sex/Life chases more often turns into a rub. As it turns out, both good sex and a good life can bloom when fed full-throated fantasy. But for Sex/Life, its soapy sexuality washes away its potential potency."
Teen Wolf,0,"While Stiles is missed in the last batch of episodes, this fun MTV show finds a nice way to say goodbye."
The Shrink Next Door,0,A drawn-out true-cringe story.
Black Sails,0,"Unfortunately, there's not a lot of wind at the back of the Emmy-winning Treasure Island prequel's final 10 episodes, and not many waves to be made by its exit."
The First Lady,0,"Watching the series attempt to make sense of itself, it’s tempting to believe that it began as three separate Michelle, Betty, and Eleanor shows before The First Lady slapped them together into one."
The Tourist,0,"What seems at the outset like a chance for Jamie Dornan to do some heavy existential lifting never quite makes good on that promise. Instead, “he Tourist”eventually settles into a conventional web of TV intrigue."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,This season should have been appropriate titled Iron Fist Season 2: An SJW Redemption Story. AKA: We're sorry we tried to sell you a white dude doing kung fu because clearly only Asians can do that.
Limitless,0,"The superhero aspects can be fun to watch, but they don't make a lot of sense."
The Offer,0,"Unfortunately, the resulting product is frequently too on-the-nose. If there’s any reason to watch, it’s for the performance of actor Matthew Goode as legendary Paramount executive Robert Evans."
Succession,0,"Succession is often very funny, and always extremely bleak. But the show's window-dressing doesn't deliver the same vicarious thrill anymore."
Inventing Anna,0,This bloated true-crime drama from Shonda Rhimes alternately seeks to scold and celebrate New York con artist Anna Delvey (Julia Garner) and the relentless reporter (Anna Chlumsky) who brought her story to light.
The White Lotus,0,"Aside from a subplot involving cultural reparations that doesn't entirely land, it would have been nice to see a bit more exposition about what point ""The White Lotus"" is ultimately trying to make."
Midnight Mass,0,"They could have just gone so much further with... the mysticism, the miracles, and even the backstories of these characters."
Losing Alice,0,"Despite the interesting way Alice and Sophie play off each other in the first two episodes, their interactions and the show as a whole has increasingly diminishing returns."
The Mist,0,"Some character depth would help maintain interest for 10 episodes around a scary fog, but from the town's cops to the high school jocks, it all feels like a mediocre horror movie. That's a hard sell for 10 weeks."
The Pentaverate,0,"We don’t expect The Pentaverate to get much funnier as the season goes along. And the longer we watch, we think the more painfully unfunny most of the gags are going to get."
The Thing About Pam,0,The Thing About Pam offers an intriguing but tonally off-putting rehash of a familiar true crime story.
Once Upon a Time,0,"As fans of the series, we don't want to add Once Upon a Time to the list of shows with disappointing final seasons, but we can't see even an unlimited amount of fairy dust in the finale changing things for the better."
Gossip Girl,0,"A few good characters caught in a terrible TV show, desperately trying to escape."
The Expanse,0,"The season feels incomplete, an insufficient and far too economical kiss off for such an intricately constructed show. It's sad to see a world built with the breadth of the universe have no room to breathe."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,Nicole Kidman rarely makes a mistake in her career choices. This time she did.
Y: The Last Man,0,"Yes, perhaps it was a rueful joke in the original comic books that the future of the male species depends upon the utterly uninteresting, immature Yorick, but here that twist is taken very seriously. The weight placed upon the character is just ludicrous."
Foundation,0,"Beneath the gunplay and C.G.I., there's a much weirder show struggling to get out, about statistics and space popes, decadent clone emperors and millennia-old robots."
Taboo,0,"This is the trouble with the show overall: It's just not clear, even after three episodes, what the fascinating James Keziah Delaney wants."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"Remembering Peter Weir's 1986 film, a descent-into-madness tragedy set entirely on the titular coast of Honduras, could be more of a hindrance to enjoying this new take."
Loot,0,"Not every show about the ultra-wealthy needs to be as biting as Succession, but Loot too often comes off as entirely toothless."
Game of Thrones,0,"SHOCKING things happened just because they had shock value. They bore no connection to anything else that had happened before them. There was hardly any organic, believable storytelling leading up to those moments. Thus, they felt shallow."
Snowflake Mountain,0,"Despite what the title may suggest, there’s nothing all that incendiary or political about Snowflake Mountain. And unlike a snowflake, there’s nothing unique about it either."
Interrogation,0,"Ultimately, not unlike the case explored by the detectives, accused killers, and put-upon lawyers of Interrogation, the show doesn't necessarily prove what it's actively trying to prove (crime dramas are interesting if you can choose your own fate)."
Taboo,0,"The focus on grim portentousness and rank atmosphere keeps bogging down the story, which needed more attention to achieve the balance it seeks among gothic bodice-ripper, Heart of Darkness social tract and corporate thriller."
The O.C.,0,A show that had so much juice seems to be running dry.
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,Nine Perfect Strangers boasts a wonderful cast that is sadly under-utilised within a series lacking both plot content and atmosphere. We wish we were seeing something on whatever wavelength Nicole Kidman's performance is on.
Treadstone,0,"Disappointing action spin-off is violent, has cursing."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,Adam McKay’s hodgepodge of postmodern filmmaking deprives the audience of any sense of discovery.
Bridgerton,0,"As soaps go, one can certainly do worse than Bridgerton, but season two... feels like a bland mimeograph of season one."
You,0,"The stakes with ""You"" always lie in Joe being a protagonist you root against. But by season three's end, we stopped enjoying the ride - all we want is for Joe to receive his comeuppance."
Normal People,0,An experience tantamount to being stuck on a bad date that refuses to end.
Y: The Last Man,0,"It's impossible to say what Y: The Last Man lost or gained from that upheaval, but what's clear is that this vanilla offering of a post-apocalyptic nightmare is no doubt arriving a decade too late."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"There is, without a doubt, much more left to say on the topic—which is why it’s such a shame to see Kelley keep repeating himself."
House of Cards,0,"The final season is not the glorious goodbye it should have been, or the one the show's best character and best actor deserved, but there's still enough of that early elegant cruelty to see it across the line."
Chernobyl,0,"That methodological approach gives the HBO Chernobyl series a distinct impression of truthiness despite factual errors, almost all of which were unsubtly designed to make the Soviet government look bad."
The Stand,0,"For those who enjoyed the original inclined to ask, ""Why do I need this?,"" the answer is pretty well ""You don't,"" other than a promised new coda to the story written by King."
True Detective,0,"I wondered what I would think if neither of the previous seasons had existed, and I realized-I probably wouldn't be thinking about it at all."
The Mist,0,The pilot episode doesn't inspire hopes that Torpe can handle a nuanced mix of horror and metaphorical context.
Lisey's Story,0,"The series is beautifully shot, features stellar performances and production values, and oozes with haunting atmosphere. That said, its story rarely achieves the high bar set by these other elements."
Night Sky,0,"A low-heat, flat-toned, limited effects science fiction Big Secret movie whose “streaming series” stretchmarks show in every damned episode."
The Umbrella Academy,0,"Gets off to a great start, but falls apart halfway through. Klaus still gets a fantastic storyline, however fellow fan favorite Five is basically benched while Allison suffers character assassination. Elliot Page's transition is handled respectfully."
Archive 81,0,"At eight episodes it's way too long. And though they're attractive, the two leads are not much more than serviceable in the acting department."
Twin Peaks,0,"""Twin Peaks"" still has the power to shock at times, but this is largely 217 characters (the number of actors in the new season) in search of an author."
Y: The Last Man,0,"Considering just how beloved Y: The Last Man is and its long development period, it's disappointing that the show's opening episodes aren't better."
We Own This City,0,"The six-part series isn't as rich as Simon's past work, in large part because it's built almost entirely out of rage. That's understandable -- but exhausting."
The Mist,0,"Given the understandably low budget, it would have been smarter to play with the unknown enemy in the mist instead of making such a literal horror show."
Preacher,0,"This has always been the thing with Preacher, from the source material on. It has plenty to say about humanity & faith & life, but to hear it you have to live through the juvenilia. With Season 4, though, for the first time, that does not feel worth it."
Lisey's Story,0,What's on screen can be bloated and exasperating. But Stephen King's eight-hour version of his favorite among his own scary novels can-thanks to stars Julianne Moore and Clive Owen-pull you up short with the beauty and terror of marriage.
Killing Eve,0,Comer and Oh do their damnedest to save scripts that appear to have a surface-level engagement with the central conflicts of the series.
The Big Conn,0,"There is no reason this needed to be four one-hour episodes. You can easily edit this down to one two-part and release it that way and the same story gets told. As you are watching it, the viewer is sitting there like, “okay, I get it.”"
Brave New World,0,Brave New World has too many parts out of place to be a success - and stripped out one of the most important parts that would have made it a success.
Halo,0,"Boasting no technological innovation to speak of, few performances to offer meaningful grounding and only limited action thrills, Halo is aggressively forgettable, which is at least several steps up from “bad.”"
The Endgame,0,"There are no visual ideas here, no narrative ideas and no core performances to keep you watching while waiting for those other attributes to emerge."
Glee,0,"While the new kids at McKinley get a few quirky gags, they feel half-hearted, as if only real remaining mission is to follow our old friends to the finish line. That's fine. But we could have done it two seasons ago and not missed much."
Interrogation,0,The most disappointing aspect of Interrogation may be the writers' reluctance to peddle uncertainty.
Lost,0,The richest fantasy series I've seen. But its wrap-up sixth season is a drag: This spidery metaphysical puzzle seems to be dwindling down to a hokey primordial myth of good and evil.
Entourage,0,"""Entourage"" seems to have undergone a certain loss of identity, at least on the evidence of the first few new shows."
Castle Rock,0,There's little apparent benefit to how the show's second season foregrounds its interpersonal relationships.
The Shrink Next Door,0,"On the whole, the series' inability to decide whether to play things straight or lean into the Ferrell and Rudd reunion makes it hard to get used to anything that's happening."
Rise,0,"Welcome to NBC's Rise, a new series that suffers from some very significant pilot-itis."
Guilty Party,0,"Guilty Party's opening episode presents us with an unbelievable, uncharismatic lead character who seems out of place and ill-equipped for every room she enters."
Godless,0,"In Godless, female empowerment resembles the adoption of a rigid construction of masculinity."
Turner & Hooch,0,"Turner & Hooch could deliver a solid family dramedy or a mindless action-comedy; by trying to be both, the show ends up neither."
Behind Her Eyes,0,An engagingly jagged and creepy revenge thriller that degenerates into a steaming pile of paranormal malarkey.
Snowflake Mountain,0,"Part reality competition and part train wreck, this is a formulaic series produced to make its cast look pathetic."
The Book of Boba Fett,0,"The spinoff of 'The Mandalorian' had an opportunity to expand what it meant to be a 'Star Wars' story, but it's consistently stopped right at the edge of actual exploration."
Peacemaker,0,"""Peacemaker"" exposes a bigger problem: in a minor role with an ensemble of zany characters, Cena's witty banter felt like a breath of fresh air. In a eight-hour episodic series with lackluster supporting players, Cena struggles to carry the load."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"Once you're in Wonderland, you might remember how dense and unfortunately dour life is there. As soon as you get there, you feel like you're ready to leave."
Glee,0,"The show ends with 121 episodes, seemingly every one a little more incoherent than the last."
Loki,0,"The idea of Loki bouncing around history and stirring up trouble is more than enough ammo for a series, but Loki makes the bizarre choice of bogging itself down under layers and layers of bureaucracy."
Godless,0,"Godless foregrounds by-the-book gunslingers and manhunts that take a promising concept and translate it into familiar, if handsomely presented, clich."
Little Voice,0,"You can slather a hip new coat of paint on it, but Little Voice is still familiar in every which way."
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,"They try to cram so much into those episodes that even potentially interesting storylines turn into a slog, and Luke's journey goes from the understandably rage-filled chapter that we see in every hero's story to a chore."
Halo,0,"As a sci-fi show that wants to deliver something more rewarding than its source material, it’s too slow to load."
Lovecraft Country,0,"Rather than be precise in its refutation of the legacy of Lovecraft, Lovecraft Country only takes the broadest possible swipes at the monster of racism, leaving the show feeling oddly one-note and shallow."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,None of these characters speak like human beings.
Band of Brothers,0,"A glorious bungle... At times visually astonishing. Unfortunately it also suffers from disorganization, muddled thinking and a sense of redundancy."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,The series is ultimately uncertain of what it wants to say.
The White Lotus,0,The White Lotus gets to fail upwards.
Suspicion,0,"Suspicion still doesnt seem to know exactly what its saying, repurposing its more political source material into a series of middle-of-the-road thriller beats that are never as gripping as they aim to be."
Hawkeye,0,"The action scenes are perfunctory, the dialogue glum rather than glittering. And the mentor-protégée chemistry between Renner and Steinfeld might be kindly described as a work in progress."
The Offer,0,"This program insists that movies are important, and does so by pulping perhaps the most celebrated film of the second half of the twentieth century and using it as fuel for a diverting but hardly cinematic streaming series."
The Outsider,0,"The performers are all strong, but in service of storytelling that doesn't always deserve them. Imagine the more overheated aspects of True Detective, but with more blatant nods to demons and far less impressive visuals."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Great monologues can exist in counterproductive prestige TV, and for all of the power that the A-list ensemble brought to this wellness retreat ... the pacing itself from director Jonathan Levine has far too little emotional momentum."
Homeland,0,"Rven though the circumstances are new... it still felt like déjà vu. We have had this vibe, this dynamic before - many times."
Turner & Hooch,0,It's fitting that McG would direct the Turner and Hooch pilot because it's about as inoffensive and bland as most of the director's output.
Bridgerton,0,"The first episode in the new season lasts eight hours and 24 minutes. No, not really. It does feel interminable, though."
Invasion,0,"A slow-moving, often tedious disaster drama, Invasion takes five episodes to get through what a blockbuster movie might take care of in half an hour."
Suspicion,0,"It brings to mind an important lesson: television works when it uses the storytelling tools at its disposal, rather than just hacking a story into pieces and expecting viewers to follow it."
BoJack Horseman,0,[T]he decision to split up the sixth and final season makes these episodes a deeply unsatisfying experience.
The First,0,"It's a series that's all countdown, but no launch."
Minx,0,It feels like a real missed opportunity that “Minx” is so unwilling to question its own assumptions: that porn is good; that feminism must be fun; and that capturing the White female moneyed gaze is the ultimate marker of the magazine’s success.
The First,0,"The seriousness of the subject doesn't entirely explain the solemnity of this pilot episode, nor the glacial pacing."
Big Shot,0,"For a show about an ace competitor who finds joy in victory, Big Shot, stacking a canny hero against a universe of people who just don't get it, sure doesn't mind playing unfair."
Marvel's Agent Carter,0,[The setup is] opting for beats so trite that they feel like they're coming out of a spy parody.
13 Reasons Why,0,"Laves nothing to chance, wrapping up almost every major loose end in what is now surely the show's trademark: throw every possible hot button issue into a blender and mash the switch labeled ""the power of friendship and de-escalation"" until smooth."
Foundation,0,"Spanning a millennium and juggling at least half-a-dozen narratives at any given moment, Foundation is suitably epic to behold, but has the emotional intensity of a lecture on particle physics."
Forever,0,"The show tries to combine the more typical tropes of a marriage sitcom with the more supernatural ones it introduces with this higher concept twist, to muddled effect."
The Haunting of Hill House,0,"Most frustratingly, the adaptation abandons the raw feminine perversity that made Jackson's story so indelible."
24,0,"Despite the high-grade action, the premiere is more a showcase for everything that was bad about 24 than a reminder of everything that was good."
Heroes,0,"Maybe I'm coming off a little harsh, but after so many years of mediocre storytelling and promises of things being better, I'm over it."
Wolf Like Me,0,"Is it a love story? A story about redemtion? About creating a trusting, loving family after tragedy has visited the home? It's hard to know what's really going on here, or why it's going on."
Y: The Last Man,0,"While no one would expect the dystopian concept to yield feel-good TV, watching society break down this way, at this moment, has a glutton-for-punishment quality without outlandish wrinkles like zombie gore to introduce a sense of escapism."
Suspicion,0,"By the time you reach the series end, the genre pleasures and the politics have gotten so tangled together and muddled that its hard to care either what happens to the characters, or what the series is trying to say."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"Jessica's 'what makes a hero?' path this season is given plenty of heavy-handed lip service but it feels more like telling than showing, especially as Luke Cage Season 2 handled similar questions much more deftly."
The Me You Can't See,0,"As an exploration of trauma and mental health, however - and one that features testimonials from figures such as Lady Gaga and Glenn Close - it's frustratingly unambitious."
The Mist,0,"To basically every character in The Mist, allow me to paraphrase the hero of the movie version of a different Stephen King novella: Get busy being better written, or get busy dying."
Ozark,0,Better Call Saul is a chess game; Ozark is a shell game that quickly rearranges characters and alliances for no real reason other than to keep the story moving.
Inside Amy Schumer,0,"All the sketches are well-produced, well-cast, and well-acted, but most are disappointingly underwritten, unfocused, or repetitive."
The Mist,0,"The Mist scatters a growing number of flat, unsympathetic characters across various locations and fails to manage the swath of social issues it attempts to tackle."
Joe vs Carole,0,"While Kate McKinnon and John Cameron Mitchell give the title characters some heart in Peacock series, this tired saga should be retired with the Zoom Happy Hours."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"The Punisher was a fun but undeniably flawed series, representative of the Netflix-Marvel universe as a model of frustrating inconsistency."
Arrested Development,0,Fine food never tastes as good when it is reheated a few days later. Arrested Development season five feels like reheated meat that smells way past its expiration date.
The Morning Show,0,"""The Morning Show"" keeps returning to this idea that even as the network is drowning an endless pool of scandal and drama, these people care. I don't know if that's supposed to be meaningful or ironic, but mostly it left me feeling nothing at all."
Star Trek: Enterprise,0,The most infuriating thing about Enterprise is the fact that it has always had some of the most potential of any of the Trek series and has always gone out of its way to squander every opportunity it has ever had to capitalize on that potential.
The Right Stuff,0,"The actors do their best to overcome the flat writing, and the show does find its stride by the fifth episode. What the new ""Right Stuff"" is missing are the qualities it can probably never have: currency and context."
Taboo,0,"With listless pacing and no characters to care about... Taboo, you win. You're the best at being the worst."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"There is too much time to fill, too many episodes to stretch a fairly thin plot across, and too many goddamn strangers to stay interested in any one of them."
Killing Eve,0,"Like many Peak TV plots, this one could have been resolved fifteen episodes ago. One senses the fatigue in the narrative with the very tone of the first episodes."
The X-Files,0,"If only Fox would do us a favor and stop bringing this one back. Fans get their hopes up, only to see them crushed again."
Arrested Development,0,No programme is more infuriatingly chuffed with itself.
The First Lady,0,"For all its glossy sheen and good intentions, The First Lady has little to offer that feels truly, meaningfully “real.”"
The Office,0,"There's some symmetry in the fact that after eight years, four Emmys, three regional managers, and an untold number of parties in the conference room, The Office's farewell feels more like an afterthought than an event."
Black Mirror,0,"In the best and worst exploitation tradition, ""Striking Vipers"" warns you not to treat others as a game. Then it goes ahead and does exactly that."
God's Favorite Idiot,0,"The series has a lot more high concept ambition and creativity than the husband-and-wife team’s previous collaborations like Tammy, but most of the laughs come from straightforward sitcom scenes of bickering co-workers."
Vigil,0,"The most credible thing that came out of anyone's mouth was Suranne Jones's post-traumatic vomit. Harsh, yes, but as the closing credits rolled I had many questions, chief among them: after six long hours, was that it?"
MacGruber,0,"An unnecessary reminder that not everything that's funny for three minutes works for two hours, much less four."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Congratulations to Iron Fist, which just leveled up from unwatchably bad to merely boring."
Players,0,Players fell short of the mark for me.
The Endgame,0,"Sure its fun to watch Baccarin regard Bathe with the same kind of amused regard an older brother gives to his younger siblings attempts at tackling him, but it gives The Endgame zero sense of stakes."
The Morning Show,0,"These cobbled together histrionic dramatics are offensive compared to the gravity of the issues of the first season. Even combined, the desperate scrambles of the second season don't have enough bite, or credibility, for the viewer to invest in."
