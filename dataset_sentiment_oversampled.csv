Show,Sentiment,Review
The Pentaverate,0,"That the resulting show isn’t good doesn’t especially matter, in the end. It’ll probably still find enough curious viewers to justify the partnership, and for Netflix, that’ll be more than enough."
The Undoing,0,"While beautiful to look at, the show struggles to say something compelling as it's more interested in amplifying the melodrama instead of delving deep into its more interesting subjects."
Stay Close,0,"The trouble with Stay Close is that it's too familiar. Despite the plethora of unexpected twists, this series manages to feel identical to every other crime drama that's been thrown out in recent years, and not a particularly great one at that."
The Haunting of Hill House,0,The virtuosity in the style is evident. That's why it's a shame that [director and writer Mike] Flanagan neglects elementary aspects like the performances and the script. [Full review in Spanish]
The Nevers,0,"This is really unpleasant, and that is all I have."
The Mysterious Benedict Society,0,"The first two episodes have a start-and-stop energy, with more tests leading to more tests, and it gets more and more tedious."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"Remembering Peter Weir's 1986 film, a descent-into-madness tragedy set entirely on the titular coast of Honduras, could be more of a hindrance to enjoying this new take."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,0,"This final season is an awkward combination of tones, as it aims to be both insightful and funny and ends up being neither."
Black Mirror,0,"Such dissonance underscores the impression, supported by the occasional but conspicuous Britishisms that issue from the mouths of American characters in the Netflix seasons, that Brooker isn't getting enough feedback on his scripts."
Outer Range,0,"Outer Range isn’t consistently satisfying as a drama series, though as an extended metaphor for television viewing circa 2022, this story of a Wyoming family throwing things in a mysterious hole on their ranch is at least unintentionally savvy."
The Essex Serpent,0,"The pacing is slow, and rather than feeling meditative or breathable, The Essex Serpent only feels mechanical, ploddingly carrying the plot forward scene to scene. Whatever electricity the leads’ performances could have lent it is thoroughly deadened."
Taboo,0,[Taboo] silently bullies you into a reverence it probably doesn't deserve.
The White Lotus,0,"What's lifted up are all of the critiques of sexism, racism, and classism. What's cancelled are the sources of these critiques, which are predominately POCs. And what's preserved is the hetero white male dominance of capitalism."
Safe,0,It's a thriller by numbers that doesn't feel clever enough for its talented cast.
Bel-Air,0,"Painfully earnest and mostly stripped of its original buoyancy, this formerly amusing and entertaining fish-out-of-water story is left gasping for an original thought."
Amazing Stories,0,"Some twists, mystery in tame but lackluster anthology."
Mindhunter,0,Mindhunter stumbles by linking the intimate lives of its protagonists with those of the psychopaths they interview and stalk. [Full Review in Spanish]
Jericho,0,"On paper, the idea of building a new democracy from the ruins of war while government contractors run amok is just as strong as the original premise of Jericho. But the execution remains mediocre."
Killing Eve,0,"Instead of something small but perfectly formed, Killing Eve has become one of those programmes that seems mainly to inspire the response, “Oh are they still making that?”"
Outer Banks,0,"If you don't want to broach the issue of race here, then don't tie the treasure to slavery. But if you're going to make that link, you have a responsibility to actually talk about it and the implications."
Glee,0,"Although it's taken a step in the right direction, the show's previous ubiquity in high school pop culture leaves it as a pale imitation of its former self in the sixth and final season's two-hour premiere."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,A story that lacks strength... torn between what it wants to tell and how. [Full review in Spanish]
The First Lady,0,"You will find no objections from me to giving each of these real women a chance to fill a whole series with their dualities, tensions, and complications. But there’s very little of that realness here."
House of Cards,0,"Artistically, Season 6 of House of Cards is a flop."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"""The Mosquito Coast"" works best when you just follow along with the running and don't think too hard about the rest, but the running itself becomes tedious after awhile. Not everything makes perfect sense, or seems remotely plausible."
The Mist,0,"The series... plays around with elements familiar to members of King's devoted fan base, as well as those from Frank Darabont's intense and somber 2007 feature film of the same name, but with less successful results."
Prison Break,0,"There's a reason the phrase ""You can't go home again"" amounts to a cliché. You really can't. Especially when home is a prison."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Little fires will quickly merge into an overwhelming flame, and even though this is the first scene of the series, Hulu's adaptation goes right ahead and burns itself out."
Sex/Life,0,"Whatever inherent truths the show explores -- marriage is hard, the magic/romance fades, etc. -- get overshadowed by the wanton silliness."
Loki,0,"Loki feels too constrained, too stale, for a story about a wayward god of mischief. Too much exposition bogs down the script."
Bridgerton,0,...it’s difficult to imagine that Bridgerton will ever make quite the splash that the first season did without stars like Page who strike the perfect balance between steamy and silly...
The Endgame,0,"Morena Baccarin and Ryan Michelle Bathe, longtime supporting players getting starring roles in a large-scale series for the first time, do not feel irreplaceable, and the show's clunky, obvious writing doesn't give them much to work with."
13 Reasons Why,0,The empathy of the first season has vanished completely. [Full Review in Spanish]
Fargo,0,"If all of this sounds like a lot of strands to tie together, it is-but unlike in previous seasons, many of these strands really feel ancillary to the gangland drama that stodgily occupies center stage."
Treadstone,0,"As spy dramas go, this one is better left out in the cold."
The O.C.,0,"Its peculiar mix of comic adult misbehavior, teen love and sexuality and sarcastic humor -- all played to a trendy musical soundtrack -- returns for a fourth season that illustrates it has stayed at the party too long."
Monsters at Work,0,"As someone who loves the films, I wonder ... do we need more of it? The films are so well self-contained. This feels like an excess of something we don't really need."""
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,"Luke Cage might be bulletproof, but the character's eponymous Netflix series looks weaker in Season 2 -- not bad, overall, but still experiencing the equivalent of a sophomore slump."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,0,"For a series dedicated to supposed historical realism, Downton Abbey wraps things up with a bow of pure fantasy."
Invasion,0,"Invasion is a ten-hour season devoid of nearly all humor, where characters across the globe continually bumble around in their own misery, resentful that aliens keep interrupting their tragic lives."
Foundation,0,"Lacking wit or self-awareness, Goyer's robot future is every bit as cold as you'd expect from a space adventure that's actually all about algebra."
The First,0,Packed with corny symbolism and inexplicable cutaways.
The Tourist,0,"What seems at the outset like a chance for Jamie Dornan to do some heavy existential lifting never quite makes good on that promise. Instead, “he Tourist”eventually settles into a conventional web of TV intrigue."
Marvel's Agent Carter,0,"You wouldn't be alone in feeling that this season of Agent Carter lacked a certain urgency...that's really the rub, that Season 2 never seemed like it had enough to say on Peggy's journey..."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Despite able performers and potent themes, the show is so addicted to chaos that it squanders its chance to say anything substantive."
Girls,0,"For a show that started off so real to its target demographic, it didn't end that way."
Heroes,0,"Maybe I'm coming off a little harsh, but after so many years of mediocre storytelling and promises of things being better, I'm over it."
Safe,0,"Safe could have been so good. All the ingredients were there for a prime binge-worthy crime thriller - the writers, the cast, the concept - but it just hasn't been given the time, care and attention it needed."
Arrested Development,0,"You could forgive all this if these episodes were funny, if they contained even a trace of the spark that made its first run so incredible. But they aren't. They're flat and lifeless and pointless."
And Just Like That...,0,"The name surely carries plenty of equity, but like the movies, this HBO Max show yields diminishing returns."
Arrested Development,0,"You could forgive all this if these episodes were funny, if they contained even a trace of the spark that made its first run so incredible. But they aren't. They're flat and lifeless and pointless."
Invasion,0,It's nothing but a kitchen sink drama as people are running and seeing weird things happening.
Suspicion,0,"The cast is appealing, but Thurman lacks energy to the point where she seems almost glazed."
Monsters at Work,0,"Has the feel of a weekday afternoon cartoon that was churned out quickly to capitalize on a successful property, featuring lesser versions of the franchise's characters."
The Act,0,Watching the series becomes a bit of a slog where you are just waiting for the crime to happen so that the narrative can move forward.
Once Upon a Time,0,OUAT season seven suffers from the same anvil-ish dialogue it always has.
Rise,0,"The cast is solid, but otherwise ""Rise"" falls flat."
Glee,0,Perhaps Ryan Murphy's most ruinous decision was to go all-out in his embrace of victimhood.
Brave New World,0,The idea of a society where pandemics have been completely eradicated may sound ideal in this particular moment. But that's the only attractive I could find in Brave New World's utopic setting. [Full Review in Spanish]
Sharp Objects,0,"It has everything to be a hit, but Sharp Objects does not captivate. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"The tone wanders, mixing scenes in ominously idyllic locations with supposedly meaningful closeups of fruit being whipped into submission for smoothies."
Lovecraft Country,0,Lovecraft Country wears its progressivism like a costume.
Roar,0,"Mostly the stories hammer you over the head with their obviousness, then peter out."
First Kill,0,"A dull, predictable Buffy the Vampire Slayer knock-off."
Bridgerton,0,"Season 1 may have left audiences hot under the collar and begging for more the first time around, unfortunately its successor is more likely to leave viewers yawning, such is the state of affairs with season two."
Ginny & Georgia,0,"There's a decent YA show in here somewhere, but along with its abundance of plot, Ginny & Georgia needs to step away from the plethora of Gilmore Girls references to get there."
Loki,0,"Loki could well improve, now that its arduous task of educating us about multiverses, and glumly explaining Loki to himself, is with any luck behind it. Let's hope so."
The Nevers,0,The Nevers begins with an intriguing premise and develops it in such a plodding way that interest progressively fades with each successive hour.
The White Lotus,0,"Instead of the series' short run delivering a well-honed critique alongside its murder mystery, the end result feels unsatisfyingly unfinished."
The Wheel of Time,0,"It does eventually bed in somewhat, but not as much as it should."
Prison Break,0,"In a particularly generous (or perverse) move, Fox is giving us not just a dead show or a dead character, but a two-for-one sale."
Foundation,0,"As a new sci-fi show, it would be fine. As a big-budget, flagship production for Apple it looks like a fine opportunity wasted."
The Witcher,0,"The show remains uneven and somewhat impenetrable to anyone not truly invested in it, which isn't helped by the long layoff."
His Dark Materials,0,With so much time taken up with gabbing there was little left for the kind of spectacle that made the first series a hit.
Loot,0,"While it has plenty of funny moments, it’s a hard pill to swallow to muster much sympathy for a character that literally has everything she wants."
Loki,0,"Loki feels too constrained, too stale, for a story about a wayward god of mischief. Too much exposition bogs down the script."
The Crown,0,The show seriously falters with Diana... The Crown prides itself on verisimilitude and that starts to fall away in Season 4.
Inventing Anna,0,"If Inventing Anna possesses any relevance at all, its due to the quality of its cast."
Limitless,0,"This is a mediocre rehash of Intelligence, which was already a humorless rip off of Chuck."
Defending Jacob,0,"This limited series strains for impact. But it's unserious about the aspects of its story that are genuinely potentially interesting, and sillier than one might have any reason to expect."
Limitless,0,A good sci-fi flick forced into a generic procedural TV show.
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,0,Fellowes hints at drama and pulls his punches.
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,"There's just too much stuff to really do justice to any of it, and that lack of focus makes it tough to latch on to anything the season is trying to do."
Lost,0,Like the televisual equivalent of a keyboard-pounding poet... At least we know that we'll only have to suffer through one more season of this foolishness.
Joe vs Carole,0,"Kate McKinnon and John Cameron Mitchell give it their best in a series that offers too little, too late."
Moon Knight,0,A six-hour series that would have worked better as a two-and-a-half-hour film.
Two and a Half Men,0,"Two and Half Men hit a new low every season and then continued to sink even further underground. During this last season, the show went off the rails in terms of absurdity and offensiveness."
We Own This City,0,"The shows talented cast and shocking plot compel, but its dry factual narrative and blind-spot-heavy examination of policing make for an ultimately unsatisfying viewing experience."
The Outsider,0,"""The Outsider"" takes an entertaining and propulsive, if routine, read and renders it with style and savvy but not much of a pulse."
Joe vs Carole,0,"In practice, Joe vs. Carole feels like a brutally over-extended Saturday Night Live sketch, leaning heavily on the jokes we know and expect while clumsily trying to tease out some deeper meaning."
BoJack Horseman,0,[T]he decision to split up the sixth and final season makes these episodes a deeply unsatisfying experience.
Moon Knight,0,"The newest MCU series on Disney+ has some interesting ideas and cool authentically Egyptian flavor, but takes its own little time to get rolling."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Though the show repeats the same mistakes as Marvel's other Netflix series, those problems are magnified because the show lacks a compelling lead."
Pieces of Her,0,"If, like me, you want something deeper, you’ll find Pieces of Her’s biggest mystery will be how this tonally mismatched, structurally messy show came to be."
The Thing About Pam,0,The flourishes used on The Thing About Pam were tiring us out by the end of the first episode; we can’t imagine how exhausted we’ll feel after watching the entire six-episode season.
Coyote,0,"Breaking Bad director Michelle MacLaren gives this series a ""Bad"" vibe, but that doesn't insure it is good... Coyote proves watchable but too derivative."
House of Cards,0,It's eight-hours of filler to set up an immensely unsatisfying conclusion.
The First,0,"It's too much buildup for too little payoff. By the time the series is ready to launch, we're already charting a course for somewhere else."
The Wheel of Time,0,"You are... left with the uneasy, then sinking, feeling that ""Wheel"" - as sumptuous a production as this is - has been done before and better. A couple of times, at least."
The Staircase,0,"I strongly considered sticking a fork in my eye at least eight times while the footage rolled... and rolled, and rolled, and rolled."
Inventing Anna,0,"Rhimes isn't shy about availing herself of artistic license. In this story, however, she forgoes fleshing out her characters and bloats each episode's runtime instead."
The Haunting of Hill House,0,The virtuosity in the style is evident. That's why it's a shame that [director and writer Mike] Flanagan neglects elementary aspects like the performances and the script. [Full review in Spanish]
Shining Girls,0,Too many threads are left dangling or unexplained. You never get that satisfying feeling of everything clicking into place by the end.
True Blood,0,Although the series could have continued - maybe by introducing zombies or mummies - True Blood had nowhere to go but in circles. It was time to put a stake in it.
We Own This City,0,"The six-part series isn't as rich as Simon's past work, in large part because it's built almost entirely out of rage. That's understandable -- but exhausting."
The Twilight Zone,0,"CBS All Access' reboot of The Twilight Zone rarely beats the audience at the guessing games it poses, or when it does, the twist is so basic as to be barely worth scoffing at."
Moon Knight,0,"Moon Knight is a snooze fest. Most of it is about MacGuffins ... and as the hero and villain chase, find, and procure them, the new Marvel series becomes too plot driven. (This also results in obvious and unnecessary exposition.)"
Loot,0,"Not every show about the ultra-wealthy needs to be as biting as Succession, but Loot too often comes off as entirely toothless."
Hawkeye,0,"For a series about a pair of sharpshooters, Hawkeye frustratingly misses the mark too often. Well, at least for viewers who aren't its target audience."
Twin Peaks,0,"""Twin Peaks"" still has the power to shock at times, but this is largely 217 characters (the number of actors in the new season) in search of an author."
House of Cards,0,"The gaping cynicism of these faux Washington insiders also paints a depressing picture of the actual current climate, especially against the backdrop of the real-life controversy in the White House."
Peacemaker,0,"""Peacemaker"" exposes a bigger problem: in a minor role with an ensemble of zany characters, Cena's witty banter felt like a breath of fresh air. In a eight-hour episodic series with lackluster supporting players, Cena struggles to carry the load."
Coyote,0,To be blunt: a show that asks its audience to connect to a rogue Border Patrol agent with literal blood on his hands needs to work harder than this one does to justify its premise.
Y: The Last Man,0,"Unfortunately, this series doesn't do enough to modernize questions from the original text."
And Just Like That...,0,"I won't lie - at some level, it's nice to catch up with them. But it lacks the spark of Sex and the City. Now it's just another show."
Suspicion,0,"Aside from a finale that feels notable only for its sloppiness, this thriller is about as forgettable as they come."
Turner & Hooch,0,"One difference between the film and the series - and it's a pretty significant one - is that Josh Peck is no Tom Hanks. Another difference - again, pretty significant - is that it's not 1989 anymore."
Twin Peaks,0,Lynch's twisted brutalization of women likewise continues... It all seems to be part of the director's basic playbook. And it's past time for him to be called out on it.
Lisey's Story,0,"There are some interesting, often supernatural connections between the characters; the hard part is wanting to stick around long enough to see where they might lead."
Heroes,0,"Once again, then, an error-riddled and confusingly-plotted episode of Heroes where everyone acted out of character, which, by this point, can be considered entirely consistent with their previous appearances."
Bridgerton,0,"The real scandal of Bridgerton: Try as it might, it’s no substitute for Jane Austen."
First Kill,0,"First Kill is a soapy supernatural star-crossed romance that doesn’t break any new ground in the genre, or elevate itself above the other mediocre series of its ilk."
Stranger Things,0,"This is the very definition of “treading water TV”, despite its big-budget fanciness, Stranger Things is really no different from any generic network procedural."
Amazing Stories,0,"With only 52 minutes of running time, The Cellar feels like a TV movie condensed to the length of a TV episode. Its characters are painted in wide brush strokes."
The Morning Show,0,"These cobbled together histrionic dramatics are offensive compared to the gravity of the issues of the first season. Even combined, the desperate scrambles of the second season don't have enough bite, or credibility, for the viewer to invest in."
Mad Men,0,Each season is starting to resemble an animated cartoon where the same landscape rolls by over and over again. We've seen a lot of these story lines before.
The Fall,0,"As good as Anderson is throughout, her Stella suffers from a Season 3 lack of development -- we learn nothing about her in this new season that we did not know from the previous two."
The First,0,"Sluggishly paced and too familiar in its character beats, it's the sort of prestige project that surely looked good on paper but fizzles once exposed to air."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,It's a shame such a wild and impulsive character is likely going out on such an underwhelming note.
Killing Eve,0,"From the first time Jodie Comer pressed a knife to Sandra Oh’s throat, the sexy murder drama seemed to promise one thing. Frustrated fans are right to be disappointed."
How I Met Your Mother,0,"""Last Forever"" brought up the idea of true love versus soul mates, and a bit about fate, but if I wanted to watch a series about how your soulmate might not be the love of your life, I'd have watched Dawson's Creek, a series which did it much better."
What If...?,0,"The light fun of it is eaten away by the cynicism from within the project, that what purports to be about infinite possibilities is blatantly more about repurposing."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,The Punisher season two is relentlessly blood and guts and that unfortunately is just punishing on to itself after a while.
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,Not since Bohemian Rhapsody have we seen scenes so poorly edited.
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"It's meant as an episode of reflection, but because previous episodes have given the relationship a flimsy foundation, Scenes still ends on its flattest note."
Sex/Life,0,Sex/Life is about as sexy as running a UV wand through a cheap motel room that hasn't changed its mattress in seven years.
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"Towards the end there was a 50-50 split between good and bad, but the first half or the show there was barely anything to like. A sad end for the Netflix MCU branch."
11.22.63,0,"The resulting eight-part miniseries is an uneven affair, at times feeling as if it's meandering through history en route to its frantic closing kick."
The Baby,0,"It’s all pretty perfunctory and over-reliant on one single, repetitive plot point that ends up not being scary, sinister, or engaging enough to compel you to see what comes next."
The Stand,0,"There's potential for this story to resonate very strongly with audiences at this moment in history, but the decision to present it out of chronological order puts everything it has to offer at risk."
The First,0,"It's a series that's all countdown, but no launch."
Monsters at Work,0,It feels like a long wait at times. The first two half-hour episodes (the only ones of the 10 that were available for review) are extraordinarily slow.
Halo,0,"Schreiber is, indeed, the most interesting thing about Halo -- which isn’t necessarily saying all that much."
Doctor Who,0,"It's not that ambition is bad, but Legend of the Sea Devils is ambitious in all the wrong ways -- the unachievable ones."
Good Sam,0,I'm as game as the next fan for a new House. This just isn't there yet.
Joe vs Carole,0,"Tiger King’s appeal was its proximity to reality, and the voyeuristic thrill of watching a convoluted and undeniably loopy story. Joe vs Carole merely photocopies it, resulting in something neither illuminating nor emotionally cathartic."
Mare of Easttown,0,"With the overwhelming variety of ""prestige"" content that exists in every nook and cranny of the internet and beyond right now, Mare of Easttown isn't exactly appointment television."
The Morning Show,0,"I liked that season one was a little campy. This season, however, summoned the ghosts of Joan Crawford, the cast of Grease 2, and Lady Gaga's Artpop era."
The OA,0,Annoying. Gripping. But annoying.
Star Trek: Picard,0,"Season 2 immediately reverses track. Star Trek: Picard gives in to audience expectation, maybe even pressure, to try and tap not just a 1990s but also 1980s nostalgia for the franchise. It largely fails at both."
Normal People,0,"Their love story is sweet, with many truthful moments of beauty and heartache... But despite the long timespan of the series' events, the characters' emotional arcs move at a much slower pace and become lost in the minutiae."
Halo,0,"Extremely generic sci-fi, and incredibly different from the source material in ways that are not justified.  This just doesn't cut it in the ultra competitive streaming arena."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"The bottom line is Apple has produced a series that not only fails to get under your skin, but mostly just makes you want to swat it away."
Tokyo Vice,0,What would Japanese people do without Americans around to explain everything to them?
Invasion,0,Invasion is an admirable attempt at subverting the expectations that come with a big budget sci-fi show about alien invaders; the only problem is that it's not very interesting or exciting.
The Mist,0,"Given the understandably low budget, it would have been smarter to play with the unknown enemy in the mist instead of making such a literal horror show."
Twin Peaks,0,"""I am dead. Yet I live,"" [Laura Palmer] said. Much the same could be said of the revival, which resembles a danse macabre, full of familiar steps, but with some new missteps all of its own."
Lisey's Story,0,"Director Pablo Larraín and a splendid cast led by Julianne Moore and Clive Owen are left with the task of making Lisey's Story cinematic, resulting in a push-and-pull that's all-too-visible, especially in the series' clumsy back-half."
Foundation,0,"The dense, at-times muddled narrative offers little to warrant the enthusiasm to justify that, leaving behind an impenetrable show that looks like several million bucks but feels as if it lacks the tools to save itself, much less all mankind."
Amazing Stories,0,"The upside of any anthology series is the possibility that the next installment can completely turn things around with a brand-new tale. Still, if this is the show's best foot forward, it doesn't imply much optimism."
Foundation,0,"Not much about Foundation sticks, either emotionally or narratively. There are cause-and-effect relationships between one event and another, but they're stretched across long-attenuated frames."
Sex/Life,0,"All of this would be laudable if the writing weren't hilariously atrocious. At least it's adhering to form, which means you can fast forward through most of it."
Entourage,0,"""Entourage"" seems to have undergone a certain loss of identity, at least on the evidence of the first few new shows."
Killing Eve,0,"Weve grown accustomed to queer characters dying on screen, especially ones in relationships. Keeping these women apart for the majority of the series, giving the characters (and fans) what they want, and then ripping it away is such a tired trope."
True Blood,0,Although the series could have continued - maybe by introducing zombies or mummies - True Blood had nowhere to go but in circles. It was time to put a stake in it.
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,The bigger problem is that it’s all just a lot of time-traveling and dealing with the rigors of time-traveling. It’s mono-thematic.
Bridgerton,0,"The first episode in the new season lasts eight hours and 24 minutes. No, not really. It does feel interminable, though."
Behind Her Eyes,0,"Here's my general opinion: I like a good twist, but the twist in Behind Her Eyes is a groaner. The series switches genres, and the final chapter felt to me like a slap in the face -- when it didn't make me laugh out loud at the absurdity."
The Mosquito Coast,0,The tone-deaf tourism of The Mosquito Coast makes for an adventure that's increasingly difficult to go along with.
The Mosquito Coast,0,"The bottom line is Apple has produced a series that not only fails to get under your skin, but mostly just makes you want to swat it away."
The Endgame,0,"It all looks quite sleek and impressive, but even after just two episodes, Elena’s ability to pull off the impossible out of nowhere begins to get old."
Moon Knight,0,"The 1st episode is fantastic, but the quality quickly drops off.  Steven is fun but Isaac makes the other personality, Marc, quite boring. Moon Knight & his mythology are sloppily defined,  making it hard to get excited about this new addition to the MCU."
Moon Knight,0,Moon Knight attempts to do something even more different in the MCU but it fails at every attempt.
Girls,0,It's unlikely anything will be fully formed - characters or tone - by the end of the final episode. Girls will stay frustrating.
The Stand,0,"While it may sound as if this would be particularly frightening to watch right now, the truth is that this much-awaited series is a bit of an anti-climax."
Pieces of Her,0,"In order to stretch out the drama...it can drag a little bit rather than make it interesting to
watch... By the time you figure out what's going on, which is four or five episodes in, it loses steam."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"In Anatomy of a Scandal, there is the matter of what constitutes consent and what is rape. But the muddled storytelling leaves the victim behind."
The X-Files,0,"Based on five episodes made available for preview, things remain uneven -- the first episode is dragged down by more conspiracy blather, interminable voiceover and way too many apocalyptic predictions of doom."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"[It] spends a great deal of time drip feeding epiphanies, dwelling in personal moments and dealing in character and yet there is a disconnect. Production design, cinematography and score all come together with direction and tone yet something is missing"
Normal People,0,"I kept yearning for these mouthwateringly beautiful people to be more convincingly nasty to each other, for the romance to take on palpable energy, fizz, danger, real sadness."
The Mist,0,"Some character depth would help maintain interest for 10 episodes around a scary fog, but from the town's cops to the high school jocks, it all feels like a mediocre horror movie. That's a hard sell for 10 weeks."
Sons of Anarchy,0,"While it will be interesting to see the way Sons tackles loose ends, in terms of how the series explores shades of gray, it looks like it's all over but the shooting."
Mare of Easttown,0,"Winslet elevates everything, but ""Mare of Easttown"" needs some serious elevating out of its dreariness and familiarity. It's certainly watchable but also predictable. Look elsewhere for light."
Arrested Development,0,"Arrested Development ending, or approaching the finish line, is the best thing for all involved. It's just sad to see everything wrap up on a ""less-than"" note and in a way that, ultimately, doesn't feel much like Arrested Development."
Game of Thrones,0,Season eight made the regrettable mistake of giving half its time to an underwhelming villain at the expense of the characters who made the show special in the first place.
The Me You Can't See,0,"There is no doubt that every contributor's motives here were pure. But standing outside and looking at the programme as an artefact and an influence on debate, one might ask whether sharing stories always means giving back"
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Elena is thinly drawn as an obviously villainous ""white savior"" and Witherspoon is repeating her performance from Big Little Lies with less nuance and shading."
Limitless,0,"Limitless comes off as rote, slick and bloodless.The show is based on the film of the same name and expect occasional Bradley Cooper drop-ins, but unless Limitless lives up to its name and starts achieving far more of its potential, I'll pass."
Halo,0,"Boasting no technological innovation to speak of, few performances to offer meaningful grounding and only limited action thrills, Halo is aggressively forgettable, which is at least several steps up from “bad.”"
The Right Stuff,0,The Right Stuff is inoffensively bland.
A Wilderness of Error,0,"A Wilderness of Error is a fascinating and informative look at a notorious piece of American history, but it struggles to defend its own relevance."
Halo,0,"Schreiber is, indeed, the most interesting thing about Halo -- which isn’t necessarily saying all that much."
Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,0,There's nothing Ashley Zukerman could have done to make Robert Landgon less of a butthead; his insufferability is a problem with the writing of the show.
Star Wars Resistance,0,"The bottom line is that Resistance... isn't really that good, or memorable. More specifically, it's a show that really doesn't know what it wants to be."
Ozark,0,"When each scene is over, it evaporates in the perpetual churn of increasingly insupportable plot points."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"The title, and the blueprints from other shows, seem disposable, or at least casually, even wastefully transposable. How predictably American, Allie Fox would probably think."
Normal People,0,"Beyond illustrating the angst of their mutual attraction with a thousand penetrating angles, Normal People's TV adaptation fails as both an adaptation and as a standalone show. Without the details of the book, the story is featureless erotica."
Lovecraft Country,0,"The new HBO series isn't interested in torquing the qualities of what's called Lovecraftian, nor inheriting them-and its episodes are weighted down by historical annotations and clumsy exposition."
Bel-Air,0,"The missing element here is the camp of a juicy soap. If we can’t laugh, then we should gasp. Remaking an iconic series is a silly endeavor—why not lean all the way into that?"
Foundation,0,"Beneath the gunplay and C.G.I., there's a much weirder show struggling to get out, about statistics and space popes, decadent clone emperors and millennia-old robots."
Lovecraft Country,0,"Pulp horror stories are best consumed in a single, quick encounter, before their limitations of plot and characterization become too obvious to ignore. Lovecraft Country is reduced to one of the walking dead long before its final credits roll."
The Night Of,0,"Actor/producer James Gandolfini's last project was meant to be a stirring indictment of the criminal justice system. Instead, it plays like an overwrought NYPD Blue episode."
The Morning Show,0,"""The Morning Show"" keeps returning to this idea that even as the network is drowning an endless pool of scandal and drama, these people care. I don't know if that's supposed to be meaningful or ironic, but mostly it left me feeling nothing at all."
Rise,0,It's time for a break from the tears. You have to earn those.
Interrogation,0,Perhaps more frustrating is that some of our time in the '80s is given to us free of a person's recollection of events.
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,My real problem with Scandal isn’t that it’s trashy or muddled in its message. I was mostly lost wondering who to care about... What’s really missing in this Anatomy lesson is its soul.
Invasion,0,Invasion is an admirable attempt at subverting the expectations that come with a big budget sci-fi show about alien invaders; the only problem is that it's not very interesting or exciting.
Arrested Development,0,"Coming across more like a tribute band to the series itself and ditching the controversial experimentation of 2013's Season 4, this second season of the comedy... is simply less original for a show that used to spark with cleverness."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,"McKay has entered... an Aaron Sorkin-esque level of directorial obtrusiveness, where a filmmaker’s tics and indulgences keep calling attention to themselves, distracting from the narrative at hand rather than amplifying it."
Killing Eve,0,"Ever since the series’ first season, Killing Eve has been stuck in a weird holding pattern when it comes to these characters... And in the final season, don’t we -- and these characters -- deserve more?"
Joe vs Carole,0,"Tiger King’s appeal was its proximity to reality, and the voyeuristic thrill of watching a convoluted and undeniably loopy story. Joe vs Carole merely photocopies it, resulting in something neither illuminating nor emotionally cathartic."
Monsters at Work,0,"Rather than lending fresh new eyes to a world first established two decades ago, Gannaway and company play a Greatest Hits montage of Monsters Inc. references."
Coyote,0,"Breaking Bad director Michelle MacLaren gives this series a ""Bad"" vibe, but that doesn't insure it is good... Coyote proves watchable but too derivative."
The Witcher,0,"The show remains uneven and somewhat impenetrable to anyone not truly invested in it, which isn't helped by the long layoff."
The Right Stuff,0,"The actors do their best to overcome the flat writing, and the show does find its stride by the fifth episode. What the new ""Right Stuff"" is missing are the qualities it can probably never have: currency and context."
The Nevers,0,"There's a lot of that carelessness throughout The Nevers. Or maybe it's just that there's simply a lot happening in The Nevers, and it's hard to keep track of it all."
Angelyne,0,Rarely makes for more than a fitfully engrossing watch.
The Pentaverate,0,"The Pentaverate rambles and repeats itself too often, even if the glimpses of Myers’ undeniable skill almost make it work and might be just enough for those who have missed him so."
Mr. Corman,0,It's disingenuous for [Joseph Gordon-Levitt] to try to get in the mind of the average man who doesn't know what he wants to do.
And Just Like That...,0,"Why is everyone so dulled down? This brings us to Samantha, whose absence may be the biggest presence on And Just Like That so far. There is no good way to write her out."
The First Lady,0,"While it celebrates women who break the mold, the show itself is deeply — and dispiritingly — conventional."
Safe,0,"Safe could have been so good. All the ingredients were there for a prime binge-worthy crime thriller - the writers, the cast, the concept - but it just hasn't been given the time, care and attention it needed."
The Undoing,0,"The Undoing is gratingly off-key. It invites us to sympathise with poor, rich Grace as her bubble of privilege bursts. Not right now, thanks."
Treadstone,0,"A show whose ambition to try to capture a world's worth of adventure seems, too often, like taking the easy way out from digging too deeply into story or character."
Waco,0,"The only way the government could look any more like buffoons, barbarians, and jackasses in the series is if the ATF and FBI sequences were soundtracked with ""Yakety Sax."""
The Stand,0,"It's curiously bland, devoid of most of the scares that King is known for, and telling a straightforward story in a faithful but lifeless manner."
The Nevers,0,"The world still feels under construction and confused about what its purpose is, something that feels indicative of the lack of a consistent architect throughout."
How I Met Your Mother,0,The ultimate takeaway from the final season is that series creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas were at once too good and not good enough to tell the story they ultimately wanted to tell.
WeCrashed,0,"Its strong start meanders to [a] repetitive, inevitable end."
Turner & Hooch,0,"Turner & Hooch could deliver a solid family dramedy or a mindless action-comedy; by trying to be both, the show ends up neither."
The Pentaverate,0,"There are rare parts of The Pentaverate that demonstrate how Mike Myers' brand of humor can still feel fun and fresh here in 2022, but too much of it proves the opposite."
WeCrashed,0,"WeCrashed establishes that shameless hustlers worth billions, even when played by Academy Award winning movie stars, are not necessarily interesting people."
Inventing Anna,0,"Inventing Anna transforms a juicy real-life drama about a con artist among the influencer crowd into a fairly inert limited series, in part by giving almost equal weight to the reporter who broke the story."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"A lot of bleeding-heart sentiments are expressed in a show where a white family traverse the hostile, corpse-ridden landscape from the US to Mexico like tourists in other people's suffering."
Black Mirror,0,The fifth season of Black Mirror isn't necessary bad -- each episode has a glimmer of something exciting -- but unfortunately that didn't quite go far enough.
Inventing Anna,0,"Delvey’s story is riveting. The series, sadly, is not."
Love Life,0,"No matter how much you can appreciate the character's journey, it's not easy for any actor to carry this type of story, but Harper would make you believe otherwise. Here's hoping he gets even better material moving forward."
Sex/Life,0,"Explicitness abounds. However, the friction that Sex/Life chases more often turns into a rub. As it turns out, both good sex and a good life can bloom when fed full-throated fantasy. But for Sex/Life, its soapy sexuality washes away its potential potency."
The Undoing,0,"The Undoing is gratingly off-key. It invites us to sympathise with poor, rich Grace as her bubble of privilege bursts. Not right now, thanks."
Bel-Air,0,A confusing series that's too tied to its sitcom roots to pass for a drama to take seriously. It's unclear with its intentions and doesn't justify its existence other than to underline a new era of streaming that's starved for content.
Foundation,0,"The dense, at-times muddled narrative offers little to warrant the enthusiasm to justify that, leaving behind an impenetrable show that looks like several million bucks but feels as if it lacks the tools to save itself, much less all mankind."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Hulu trotted out Little Fires Everywhere, an eight-part limited series that attempts to capture the sprawling nature of the source material, but ultimately fails."
The Crown,0,"Sadly, what we get here from the Peter Morgan-created series is substantially tweaked timelines and substandard soap that is far less ""character"" and more live-action spitting image caricature."
Limitless,0,"With this new series, CBS seems to have squandered the potential of a weird, compelling premise by cramming it into an average procedural crime-show mold."
Rise,0,"The problem is, even with its many storylines, Rise's attempt at making the viewer a part of this small town's community, it is just too prescribed."
How I Met Your Mother,0,"""Last Forever"" brought up the idea of true love versus soul mates, and a bit about fate, but if I wanted to watch a series about how your soulmate might not be the love of your life, I'd have watched Dawson's Creek, a series which did it much better."
The Afterparty,0,"If you're a fan of Haddish or anyone else involved, I'd recommend you look for your yuks elsewhere. Billed as a genre-defying murder mystery, the only thing this tone-deaf pastiche-fest defies is a reason to be seen."
The Pentaverate,0,"We don’t expect The Pentaverate to get much funnier as the season goes along. And the longer we watch, we think the more painfully unfunny most of the gags are going to get."
House of Cards,0,"With or without Kevin Spacey, it's possible that House of Cards had simply run its course. It's just a shame that it couldn't make one final sprint toward the finish line."
The Nevers,0,To paraphrase Coco Chanel: This is a TV show that should look in the mirror and take off one plot point before exiting the house.
Night Sky,0,More of an exercise in frustration than anything else.
The Me You Can't See,0,"There is no doubt that every contributor's motives here were pure. But standing outside and looking at the programme as an artefact and an influence on debate, one might ask whether sharing stories always means giving back"
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Because the cast is so strong, they bring some poignancy to these roles... These are all intriguing personalities. Yet Kelley and his writing and directing team can't find a definitive lens to frame what the story is meant to convey about them."
Severance,0,Ben Stiller's horror series Severance asks interesting questions but gets lost in giving the answers.
God's Favorite Idiot,0,"The series has a lot more high concept ambition and creativity than the husband-and-wife team’s previous collaborations like Tammy, but most of the laughs come from straightforward sitcom scenes of bickering co-workers."
Entourage,0,"Once fizzy and stuffed with A-list cameos, Entourage ends on a flat note and with a recurring role for Andrew Dice Clay."
The Beatles: Get Back,0,"Is it incredible and fascinating to witness the footage in Peter Jackson's ""The Beatles: Get Back"" doc-series? Hell, yes. Is it fascinating to watch the unfocused, directionless 6-hour-plus version of this meandering documentary? Not, really."
House of Cards,0,"With or without Kevin Spacey, it's possible that House of Cards had simply run its course. It's just a shame that it couldn't make one final sprint toward the finish line."
WeCrashed,0,"This meaty showcase for Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway is wrapped in a somewhat malnourished limited series, with the misfortune of coming at the tail end of several better productions about high-stakes startups whose founders flew too close to the sun."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,It really should be known for is pulling back the curtain on the way the superhero genre can encourage the worst in us.
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,0,"The show feels like more Star Wars: Clone Wars, and yet never reaches the heights that it's sister series did, and ultimately doesn't find it's own voice as a result."
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,"There's just too much stuff to really do justice to any of it, and that lack of focus makes it tough to latch on to anything the season is trying to do."
Brave New World,0,"Sadly, beyond those genre departures that seem like, let's be honest, products of inconsistent tone in the show's writing and direction, Brave New World doesn't offer much."
All American,0,"I expected more from this show - do better, All American."
Pieces of Her,0,"Well acted and highly suspenseful, the eight-part Netflix thriller “Pieces of Her” never lets up. This is a good thing for the first five episodes. Then it grows exhausting."
Dr. Brain,0,"It does go some way to fulfilling it prophecy in terms of jump scares, eerie underground car parks and ominous shadows, but is let down by a plot which requires Cliffs Notes."
Rise,0,"Yes, a talented, experienced, ""difficult"" woman was passed over for a job because an amateurish white guy woke up one day and decided he wanted to switch career paths."
Brave New World,0,"The constant writhing of beautiful bodies isn't enough to keep the interest in a show with a plotline as thin as ice. Lazy writing with no engaging qualities leaves this one, one tough pill to swallow."
WandaVision,0,"While it's far too early to assess the nine-episode, $150 million gamble fully, so far it's interestingly bad."
Glee,0,"While the new kids at McKinley get a few quirky gags, they feel half-hearted, as if only real remaining mission is to follow our old friends to the finish line. That's fine. But we could have done it two seasons ago and not missed much."
The Undoing,0,"The Undoing is gratingly off-key. It invites us to sympathise with poor, rich Grace as her bubble of privilege bursts. Not right now, thanks."
Queer as Folk,0,"Queer as Folk always felt dangerous and interesting, as if we were peeking in on a world we shouldn’t. The reboot feels jaded, as if we are watching things we’ve seen a hundred times before."
House of Cards,0,"The story picks up on the 4th of July, but it hardly feels like a birthday party with so much repetitive plotting and counterplotting going on."
Reacher,0,"Reacher hits all of the required beats of the story but never does it with a kinda of aplomb. There’s all the elements presented here, but there doesn’t seem to be much in the way of depth and the filmmaking leaves a lot to be desired."
The Nevers,0,As creaky as these first four episodes are - reams of exposition alternating between soap-opera twists and cutesy inventions like Penance's li'l electric car - I want to believe there are glimmers of promise.
And Just Like That...,0,"I won't lie - at some level, it's nice to catch up with them. But it lacks the spark of Sex and the City. Now it's just another show."
Limitless,0,"The superhero aspects can be fun to watch, but they don't make a lot of sense."
The Thing About Pam,0,The flourishes used on The Thing About Pam were tiring us out by the end of the first episode; we can’t imagine how exhausted we’ll feel after watching the entire six-episode season.
Limitless,0,"With this new series, CBS seems to have squandered the potential of a weird, compelling premise by cramming it into an average procedural crime-show mold."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,Adam McKay’s hodgepodge of postmodern filmmaking deprives the audience of any sense of discovery.
Godless,0,I was excited for it... I think I fell asleep within the first 10 minutes of it. It was so unbelievably boring.
The Morning Show,0,"I'm not certain the show has anything to say, overall, about the news industry, about sexual abuse, about complicity, about cancel culture, or about workplace politics; so it has become one big time-filling mash of histrionics."
Chernobyl,0,Mazin name-checks most of the pertinent facts of the story. But his cheap theatrics... detract from the real tragedy of the story.
The Wheel of Time,0,"Early on, the wanderers take refuge in a cursed city, its deserted streets lined with baroque architecture and statuary. ""Wheel,"" as a production, feels like that. It's a breathtakingly detailed edifice with no people in it."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,One crucial departure from the formula is the writing.
Rise,0,Imagine if Glee and Friday Night Lights had a baby and that child overdosed on Lifetime movies.
Sex/Life,0,"Rather than interrogate why Billie's sublimated her needs for the sake of a relationship, the series seems concerned only with titillating viewers -- and, despite Shahi and Demos' athleticism and enthusiasm, even that gets old."
WeCrashed,0,
The Endgame,0,"It all looks quite sleek and impressive, but even after just two episodes, Elena’s ability to pull off the impossible out of nowhere begins to get old."
Squid Game,0,"The low-effort concept [and] the pastel palette freckled with blood, Squid Game is a shallow story that uses a social issue as a platform for shocking violence. Yawn."
True Blood,0,If there's any show that should go out with a bang it should be this one. Right now its looking like its going to be all whimper.
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"There is something algorithmic, machine-made about the series, as if all involved were assembled by a computer trying to simulate buzz-worthy television. Come to think of it, that might make a more interesting series."
Friends,0,"Even the kiss that cemented Ross and Rachel couldn't disguise the show's larger anti-climax, a cop-out from the logical conclusions of the show's premise, conclusions it began to acknowledge only to ultimately deny their existence."
Twin Peaks,0,"The original run is one of TV's masterpieces, and Lynch finally returning to this project -- and unshackled by network restrictions -- was great news. In retrospect, limitations might have been welcome since this suffers from extreme excess and overkill."
Moon Knight,0,A series that ultimately feels rushed.
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Kidman has the range to play both the unicorn and the woman, but nobody bothered to give her the more important part of that equation."
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"The first time it happened, I thought I'd pressed play on a behind-the-scenes special. By the time episode three rolled around, I started shouting 'No!' at the telly."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,There are several bizarre gaps in the shows structure.
Watchmen,0,"Lindelof keeps scribbling in the margins, adding in more and more story that may yet pay off but that takes perhaps undue patience in the interim."
Brave New World,0,"As it unfolds, ""Brave New World"" fits only the most nebulous sense of the word ""interesting,"" with its most relevant commentary left behind in the Savage Lands."
And Just Like That...,0,"Modernizing the original's much-beloved and extremely glamorous world has for some reason meant making it drearier, more awkward, and overall less joyful to inhabit."
The Shrink Next Door,0,The execution of the story doesn't feel balanced as an eight-episode series. It's oddly surface level at the same time never diving into the nuance or the complexities of how this could have happened.
Starstruck,0,"The reason why romantic comedies never have sequels is because either everything is going well with the couple and there’s nothing to watch. Or, there is conflict and the original love story is ruined. Starstruck’s second season suffers from the latter."
Foundation,0,"While shows don't need to hold our hands or slowly spoon-feed us information, they do need to help us follow along. No one enjoys feeling like they're missing something, but that's exactly what happens as you sit down to watch these episodes."
The Endgame,0,"The Endgame is by turns boring and by other turns generic and nonsensical. Its story isn’t compelling enough to follow beyond the first episode, and we’re figuring that the interplay between its stars isn’t enough to keep people watching."
Suspicion,0,"It brings to mind an important lesson: television works when it uses the storytelling tools at its disposal, rather than just hacking a story into pieces and expecting viewers to follow it."
The Essex Serpent,0,"If you are hoping for Crimson Peak or The Others, this isn’t it either. But, if you are a fan of Jane Eyre or deliberately paced 19th-century British dramas with solid performances, you may enjoy The Essex Serpent. Just don’t say I didn’t warn you."
Twin Peaks,0,Lynch's twisted brutalization of women likewise continues... It all seems to be part of the director's basic playbook. And it's past time for him to be called out on it.
Boardwalk Empire,0,"These great clunking scenes are not only dull and unnecessary, they also draw unwanted attention to Boardwalk's greatest weakness. Empathy can't be retconned. It has to be earned."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"The show's signature fight scenes are still fantastic, as is the Punisher himself, Jon Bernthal. But something seemed to go wrong in the writers' room this go-round."
The Wheel of Time,0,"It does eventually bed in somewhat, but not as much as it should."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Kidman has the range to play both the unicorn and the woman, but nobody bothered to give her the more important part of that equation."
Waco,0,"The show creates its own problems in telling this story, especially as it can't seem to handle the scope."
Schmigadoon!,0,"Strong, who's one of the producers, is clearly having a ball, but Key is sold shockingly short by a lame script that starves him of funny lines and requires him to do nothing but moan."
Mare of Easttown,0,"Winslet elevates everything, but ""Mare of Easttown"" needs some serious elevating out of its dreariness and familiarity. It's certainly watchable but also predictable. Look elsewhere for light."
Bridgerton,0,"As soaps go, one can certainly do worse than Bridgerton, but season two... feels like a bland mimeograph of season one."
The Right Stuff,0,"There's not a lot of wonder or enthusiasm to this version of The Right Stuff, which mostly treats the space program as a grim endurance test."
The Mist,0,The Mist unfolds as though we'll be surprised to learn that humans are capable of cruelty.
Angelyne,0,Rarely makes for more than a fitfully engrossing watch.
Defending Jacob,0,Underneath this tale... is pretty standard fare and about two hundred minutes too long.
Coyote,0,To be blunt: a show that asks its audience to connect to a rogue Border Patrol agent with literal blood on his hands needs to work harder than this one does to justify its premise.
Jericho,0,"On paper, the idea of building a new democracy from the ruins of war while government contractors run amok is just as strong as the original premise of Jericho. But the execution remains mediocre."
The First Lady,0,"Despite a stacked deck of talented stars and what looks to be sizeable production budget, The First Lady is dead on arrival."
Foundation,0,"Spanning a millennium and juggling at least half-a-dozen narratives at any given moment, Foundation is suitably epic to behold, but has the emotional intensity of a lecture on particle physics."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,0,"I... didn't really like this season. More clunkers than good episodes, but ""Chosen"" still stands as one of the best series finales I've ever seen."
24,0,"The contemporary anxiety 24 hopes to exploit this time around is of drones and of the increasingly dehumanized nature of warfare, but it has become a sort of dehumanized show, populated by barely human characters."
The Fall,0,"If Season 3 is the last season of Netflix's The Fall, it went out on a strange note."
Prison Break,0,"As is so often the case, creating buzz worthy content doesn't necessarily translate into content that justifies its existence beyond causing a stir. That's largely how Prison Break feels."
Squid Game,0,"Like Joker, there's a having-it-both-ways insistence that a culture that could create violence is inherently sick and deranged, while playing out a wildly overstated version of sick derangement in a manner designed to be maximally tense and amusing."
The Wheel of Time,0,It all feels somewhat conventional. Is it the show's fault or because many fantasy film and television adaptations have already been made? [Full review in Spanish]
The Offer,0,"This program insists that movies are important, and does so by pulping perhaps the most celebrated film of the second half of the twentieth century and using it as fuel for a diverting but hardly cinematic streaming series."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,There are several bizarre gaps in the shows structure.
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"A dour, flavorless combination of familiar crime-drama elements, led by Renner at his most glum."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,0,The Man Who Fell to Earth is like the worst kind of tech bro -- it doesn’t offer anything innovative enough to actually live up to its own hype.
Moon Knight,0,"Moon Knight is a snooze fest. Most of it is about MacGuffins ... and as the hero and villain chase, find, and procure them, the new Marvel series becomes too plot driven. (This also results in obvious and unnecessary exposition.)"
Schmigadoon!,0,"Strong appears genuinely entertained and can hold a lovely note alongside the rest of the stage-ready cast. Still, neither the writing nor direction take advantage of the skills that Strong has honed throughout her time on Saturday Night Live."
Stranger Things,0,Season 4 was a 13-hour-plus behemoth that added Wes Craven to its mood board but otherwise ended with undeveloped characters and obvious but superficial allusions to contemporary crises.
Pieces of Her,0,"Well acted and highly suspenseful, the eight-part Netflix thriller “Pieces of Her” never lets up. This is a good thing for the first five episodes. Then it grows exhausting."
The Most Dangerous Animal of All,0,"There's a lot to like in the second half of the season, but the buy-in requires you to move through some weaker material."
A Teacher,0,"That economy is one noticeable thing about ""A Teacher."" More noticeable is how seldom it feels like a cautionary tale, despite the onscreen cautions and referrals to sexual assault resources and the story's occasional explicit references."
Invasion,0,"Unfortunately, Invasion also borrows The Walking Deads molasses-like pace, without any of the payoff or precise characterization. The first season builds to a climax, sure, but its a story that lacks depth throughout."
Game of Thrones,0,"It's such a fundamental shift of priorities that, for all of season 8's technical virtues and the sound resolution of a few story beats, it still can't help but feel like a betrayal of the show's ethos"
Coyote,0,Assembled from spare parts left over from previous television trends and decaying prejudices.
The Queen's Gambit,0,"""Alma's not pathetic, she's just stuck,"" says Beth about her adopted mother. I can't think of a better way to summarize this unfortunately arrested miniseries."
Bel-Air,0,"The missing element here is the camp of a juicy soap. If we can’t laugh, then we should gasp. Remaking an iconic series is a silly endeavor—why not lean all the way into that?"
The Mist,0,There's room for interesting rehashes that bring new perspectives and ideas. The Mist is definitely not one of them.One adaptation was enough.
Sex/Life,0,A show that has no idea what kind of message it wants to send.
The Afterparty,0,"If you're a fan of Haddish or anyone else involved, I'd recommend you look for your yuks elsewhere. Billed as a genre-defying murder mystery, the only thing this tone-deaf pastiche-fest defies is a reason to be seen."
Prison Break,0,This was most definitely not the way I wanted nor expected season five to get underway. But here's hoping somehow the show is able to catch its footing because Ogygia was a complete and utter letdown.
The Morning Show,0,"There are too many people on this show, and without exactly being sure what the series' point is, there's no way for the writers to know who to focus on. But I just know it shouldn't be the men."
Inventing Anna,0,"Rhimes isn't shy about availing herself of artistic license. In this story, however, she forgoes fleshing out her characters and bloats each episode's runtime instead."
The Boondocks,0,The Boondocks is wrapping up its run by being more like Al Pacino as Al Pacino in Jack and Jill: a sad-looking shell of itself that sometimes recaptures its past spark but has seen better days.
Rise,0,"The cast is solid, but otherwise ""Rise"" falls flat."
The Nevers,0,Astonishingly pedestrian.
Invasion,0,"While it's an ambitious, sometimes welcome subversion of the genre, the approach often works to the series' detriment."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,0,"Part of that may be because of the vitality of its guests, Jenifer Lewis and Bassem Youssef. Maybe ""the problem"" with the series is Stewart himself."
Marvel's Agent Carter,0,It became... nothing more than a Hayley Atwell vehicle that let everything else from production value to narrative importance fall to the wayside if it meant the show's lead actress getting in just one extra spunky line of dialogue.
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,"Winning Time is guaranteed to turn the stomachs of not only Boston Celtics fans, but anyone hoping for more than an egregiously cartoonish and ham-fisted hagiography executed with all the subtlety of a no-look pass."
How I Met Your Mother,0,The ultimate takeaway from the final season is that series creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas were at once too good and not good enough to tell the story they ultimately wanted to tell.
Hawkeye,0,"If you are very much plugged into the Marvel Universe, yes its a Must Watch. If youre not that bothered, then no."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,It really should be known for is pulling back the curtain on the way the superhero genre can encourage the worst in us.
Castle Rock,0,"In this misguided series, the clash between grounded psychological horror and bump-in-the-night monster mania delivers fewer shivers than shrugs of confusion."
The Pentaverate,0,A profoundly unfunny series of sex and poop jokes.
Ozark,0,I was annoyed and rolling my eyes. I was on the edge of my seat wondering if the show would do anything truly surprising.
Invasion,0,"Unfortunately, Invasion also borrows The Walking Deads molasses-like pace, without any of the payoff or precise characterization. The first season builds to a climax, sure, but its a story that lacks depth throughout."
Bel-Air,0,"Suck all the joy, exuberance and wondrous charisma out of “The Fresh Prince” — a worthy launchpad for an actor who, in his prime, was widely considered the biggest movie star in the world — and you’re left with the gloomy and plodding “Bel-Air.”"
Behind Her Eyes,0,Anything beneath the surface in Behind Her Eyes is irrelevant by the end.
11.22.63,0,"11.22.63 sets forth with a fascinating premise, but gets a little too distracted by superfluous material that only causes it to get sidetracked from the main plot, resulting in a slightly unfocused show with problematic execution."
And Just Like That...,0,"Why is everyone so dulled down? This brings us to Samantha, whose absence may be the biggest presence on And Just Like That so far. There is no good way to write her out."
Lisey's Story,0,"Director Pablo Larraín and a splendid cast led by Julianne Moore and Clive Owen are left with the task of making Lisey's Story cinematic, resulting in a push-and-pull that's all-too-visible, especially in the series' clumsy back-half."
The Essex Serpent,0,"At least the drama lights up whenever Hiddleston appears on screen. Because it’s otherwise desperately dreary, which is unforgivable when the source material is so rich."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"If you enjoyed season 1 you'll be perfectly happy with this addition, but it doesn't do anything interesting with a character who should feel more relevant to our current political climate."
Interrogation,0,"Interrogation is just good enough to be frustrating for the ways in which it isn't yet better, and most of them stem back to the original sin of the show's format."
Coyote,0,To be blunt: a show that asks its audience to connect to a rogue Border Patrol agent with literal blood on his hands needs to work harder than this one does to justify its premise.
Taboo,0,"The focus on grim portentousness and rank atmosphere keeps bogging down the story, which needed more attention to achieve the balance it seeks among gothic bodice-ripper, Heart of Darkness social tract and corporate thriller."
Ginny & Georgia,0,"If the writers trimmed away one or two, the mother-daughter tension at its core could shine. But with so much going on, that dynamic gets lost."
Brave New World,0,"It spends so much time reveling in its own aesthetic that dramatic momentum becomes an afterthought. At the same time, there are real ideas contained within the nine-part series. Some of them are actually in the book."
The Mist,0,The pilot episode doesn't inspire hopes that Torpe can handle a nuanced mix of horror and metaphorical context.
Weeds,0,It felt like the Weeds finale could have been more focused and a bit more eventful.
The First Lady,0,"Watching the series attempt to make sense of itself, it’s tempting to believe that it began as three separate Michelle, Betty, and Eleanor shows before The First Lady slapped them together into one."
The Nevers,0,"It is, indeed, steampunk Buffy with corsets -- and for several reasons, that's no longer an enticing concept."
The Fall,0,"This show thinks it is Very Important Viewing, unmissable drama, televisual literature. The fact is it's very missable indeed."
Suspicion,0,"Suspicion raises too many doubts, and fails to resolve any of them."
Moon Knight,0,"The 1st episode is fantastic, but the quality quickly drops off.  Steven is fun but Isaac makes the other personality, Marc, quite boring. Moon Knight & his mythology are sloppily defined,  making it hard to get excited about this new addition to the MCU."
Hannibal,0,It's difficult to love a show that seems to be trying to hard to be impenetrable to viewers to the point that it's practically begging to be canceled with such uninviting storytelling.
Inventing Anna,0,"Rhimes isn't shy about availing herself of artistic license. In this story, however, she forgoes fleshing out her characters and bloats each episode's runtime instead."
Bel-Air,0,"The scriptwriting has to be superb, and too often here, things fall flat -- plot lines are too predictable, character motivations are slightly questionable, and the dialogue can be a bit too expositional."
Midnight Mass,0,The final scene was so nauseatingly mawkish I had to hide behind the sofa screaming to be put out of my misery.
Taboo,0,"As Taboo goes forward, Delaney's mystical powers will inevitably play a more central role, but as of now, the promise that the show has some payoffs hidden up its sleeve isn't enough to slog through the dampness with these characters."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"The Time Traveler's Wife focuses so much on the time travel element, it fails to build the relationship between the lead characters, which should be the heart of the series."
WeCrashed,0,
The Undoing,0,"It's all extremely rote, like an expanded version of the mid-budget Nineties movie that would have starred Kidman and Grant at their respective heights of celebrity."
Normal People,0,"Their love story is sweet, with many truthful moments of beauty and heartache... But despite the long timespan of the series' events, the characters' emotional arcs move at a much slower pace and become lost in the minutiae."
A Wilderness of Error,0,"Morris is asking us to consider an unlikely and generally unheralded possibility, and doing so in a manner so insistent as to make the proposition less and less appealing."
13 Reasons Why,0,The empathy of the first season has vanished completely. [Full Review in Spanish]
Boardwalk Empire,0,"These great clunking scenes are not only dull and unnecessary, they also draw unwanted attention to Boardwalk's greatest weakness. Empathy can't be retconned. It has to be earned."
Schmigadoon!,0,"Simply put, it's sporadically fun but a little too cute for its own good."
The Office,0,"The Office has seemed lost, particularly by devoting substantial time to world-building Dwight's beet farm, a remnant of a failed spin-off effort."
A Teacher,0,"Mara and Robinson really are excellent, and the series has unsettling atmosphere to spare. But outside of some specific moments in its second half, A Teacher feels as superficial and generic as its title."
And Just Like That...,0,"Nearly a quarter of a century later, And Just Like That affirms that Carrie, Charlotte and Miranda failed to mature into women any sane person would want to spend time with, let alone to grow up to be."
The Mist,0,"Okay, it's possible I'm overreacting here just a smidge. But Spike's version of The Mist is one dumb piece of work."
True Detective,0,Mahershala Ali is the most notable thing about this third season that desperately tries to imitate the first season. [Full Review in Spanish]
The Wilds,0,"By starting from scratch with a whole new group of characters, The Wilds bifurcates its focus and renders everything more shallow as a result."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,0,"The final season was a chance for the show to engage in some systemic critique; its attempts to do so, however, largely fell flat... A soft-pedaled version of policing and the people who do it."
Invasion,0,It's nothing but a kitchen sink drama as people are running and seeing weird things happening.
Treadstone,0,"While the action in Treadstone is great, there just isn't enough plot to make a satisfying watch."
Big Shot,0,"For a show about an ace competitor who finds joy in victory, Big Shot, stacking a canny hero against a universe of people who just don't get it, sure doesn't mind playing unfair."
The Stand,0,"It's curiously bland, devoid of most of the scares that King is known for, and telling a straightforward story in a faithful but lifeless manner."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"Bad wigs, limp characterization, indifferent plotting."
Riverdale,0,"special events are not canon, which means that it's all a meaningless stunt designed to incorporate The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina into Riverdale and give K.J. Apa fans a brief heart attack."
Hannibal,0,It's difficult to love a show that seems to be trying to hard to be impenetrable to viewers to the point that it's practically begging to be canceled with such uninviting storytelling.
Marvel's Hero Project,0,"The real-world stories are inspiring enough. The framing device, in which the word ""Marvel"" is pronounced as often as is (slightly more than) seemly, is a distraction that feels like self-promotion."
The Stand,0,"With its many subplots, some more compelling than others, it's an uneven series that's not so much a must-watch as a can-watch."
Arrested Development,0,"Season five proved that Arrested Development could imitate its glory years, but the Bluths don't seem to have anything funny left to say."
Y: The Last Man,0,"Unfortunately, this series doesn't do enough to modernize questions from the original text."
Pieces of Her,0,It just could have been so much better.
The White Lotus,0,"If you like rich, self-absorbed bores whining and wittering among themselves, fantastic."
Coyote,0,Assembled from spare parts left over from previous television trends and decaying prejudices.
Prison Break,0,The nostalgia works against the show.
Inventing Anna,0,"Rhimes isn't shy about availing herself of artistic license. In this story, however, she forgoes fleshing out her characters and bloats each episode's runtime instead."
The Queen's Gambit,0,"While it is frustrating to see Black characters still reduced to stereotypes in what has been the supposed golden age for Black roles and representation in television, it's not all that surprising."
And Just Like That...,0,The show feels like it's trying to reverse-engineer itself through a lot of virtue signaling...
Inventing Anna,0,"While it may tell Annas story, it does so in the most basic, bare-bones manner, devoid of any real personality, fire, or even genuinely compelling characters  thanks mostly in part to the shows (sometimes painfully) lackluster scripts."
Sex/Life,0,"Whatever inherent truths the show explores -- marriage is hard, the magic/romance fades, etc. -- get overshadowed by the wanton silliness."
The Wheel of Time,0,"The Wheel Of Time is definitely a talky mess of a show, at least to start. It throws a lot of characters at us, but somehow all the time taken to establish them doesn't give us any more idea about them than when the episode started."
Taboo,0,"... if you have ever wished to know what you get when too many alpha males gather in a room, perhaps this is it."
Shameless,0,"I understand that Shameless continues to find Frank useful, but the results are never actually interesting, nor do they ever add up to anything."
The Gilded Age,0,Wharton is unlikely to have approved of such a half-hearted imitation of her work.
Inventing Anna,0,"Inventing Anna is a meandering and shallow take on Anna Sorokin's story, glacially paced with superfluous tangents that distract from the character we're really interested in."
Arrested Development,0,"The problem with evoking past highlights as a narrative device, however, is that it relies on an unsullied memory of what's being evoked."
Sharp Objects,0,"Vallée seems more interested in making everything look ""dark,"" rather than let his fantastic actors take us through their emotional journey."
Prison Break,0,The not-so-good news about Prison Break is that the suspension of disbelief it requires is simply a bridge too far.
Amazing Stories,0,"Some twists, mystery in tame but lackluster anthology."
Defending Jacob,0,The worst thing about Apple TV+'s new limited series Defending Jacob is that it feels like every other crime series we've seen before.
Lisey's Story,0,"Director Pablo Larraín and a splendid cast led by Julianne Moore and Clive Owen are left with the task of making Lisey's Story cinematic, resulting in a push-and-pull that's all-too-visible, especially in the series' clumsy back-half."
Turner & Hooch,0,"Turner & Hooch could deliver a solid family dramedy or a mindless action-comedy; by trying to be both, the show ends up neither."
The Queen's Gambit,0,"""Alma's not pathetic, she's just stuck,"" says Beth about her adopted mother. I can't think of a better way to summarize this unfortunately arrested miniseries."
True Blood,0,If there's any show that should go out with a bang it should be this one. Right now its looking like its going to be all whimper.
The Endgame,0,"The Endgame is by turns boring and by other turns generic and nonsensical. Its story isn’t compelling enough to follow beyond the first episode, and we’re figuring that the interplay between its stars isn’t enough to keep people watching."
Rise,0,"Mr. Radnor is not convincing -- or he is, but in the wrong ways."
The Thing About Pam,0,"A watchable if often underwhelming true crime docudrama that wants to both be weird and play it safe, ending up in a strange middle ground between the two."
God's Favorite Idiot,0,"This series seems to aspire to be something in between a workplace comedy and a supernatural romp, and it has its moments, yet as much as we love the actors not every comic premise succeeds."
Roar,0,"In its attempts to universalize these intensely personal experiences, Roar loses much of the heart that makes them worth caring about to begin with."
Prison Break,0,This was most definitely not the way I wanted nor expected season five to get underway. But here's hoping somehow the show is able to catch its footing because Ogygia was a complete and utter letdown.
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Despite able performers and potent themes, the show is so addicted to chaos that it squanders its chance to say anything substantive."
Altered Carbon,0,"I found myself desperately wishing for Altered Carbon to leave its world of endless lives, satellite back ups, and shapeless political revolutions behind, to focus... on the AIs discarded by humanity as yet another resource to be wasted and forgotten."
The Old Man,0,"The veteran actor does nuanced work as usual, but the FX series takes too many ridiculous turns."
The Morning Show,0,"After watching Season 2, I struggle to be certain what this show is about. The answer, at this point, really isn't ""a morning show."""
The O.C.,0,"Its peculiar mix of comic adult misbehavior, teen love and sexuality and sarcastic humor -- all played to a trendy musical soundtrack -- returns for a fourth season that illustrates it has stayed at the party too long."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,0,"Carrying those extra 15 minutes, ""The Problem"" drags; its monologues need honing, its jokes, if they stick around, need punching up, and its segments need to be trimmed down to the essence."
Losing Alice,0,Director and writer Sigal Avin so belabors the point that an idle mind can stray into self-destruction that Losing Alice paradoxically has the same effect on its viewers.
The Endgame,0,"Morena Baccarin and Ryan Michelle Bathe, longtime supporting players getting starring roles in a large-scale series for the first time, do not feel irreplaceable, and the show's clunky, obvious writing doesn't give them much to work with."
Lisey's Story,0,"The Apple TV+ limited series lands in the shallow end of the King cinematic pool, with a convoluted story that mostly squanders its big-name cast."
Defending Jacob,0,Defending Jacob feels like a huge miss for Apple TV+.
True Detective,0,"True Detective Season 3 is a little more workmanlike and less baroque, perhaps too eager to prove that it can tell a legible story again."
Homeland,0,"Overall the first four episodes made available for review plod along... But then, just as I'm about to write off this final season, something happens at the end of the fourth episode that pulls me right back in. Just like Carrie, I can't seem to let go."
Joe vs Carole,0,"While Kate McKinnon and John Cameron Mitchell give the title characters some heart in Peacock series, this tired saga should be retired with the Zoom Happy Hours."
The Endgame,0,"There are no visual ideas here, no narrative ideas and no core performances to keep you watching while waiting for those other attributes to emerge."
The Outsider,0,"""The Outsider"" takes an entertaining and propulsive, if routine, read and renders it with style and savvy but not much of a pulse."
Entourage,0,"Entourage feels awfully washed-out and washed-up, kind of like Vince Chase's dormant career, as the show counts down to the end."
Defending Jacob,0,Defending Jacob feels like a huge miss for Apple TV+.
Big Little Lies,0,The flattening of previously full characters may be the biggest loss of this season.
The Mist,0,"The Mist scatters a growing number of flat, unsympathetic characters across various locations and fails to manage the swath of social issues it attempts to tackle."
Prison Break,0,"Fox's revival, alas, begins with a flawed blueprint, while suffering from a been-there, broke-out-of-that quality."
The Pentaverate,0,"Got some good laughs out of the first three episodes, but I grew weary."
Treadstone,0,Kring still hasn't figured out that momentum isn't the same thing as complexity...
The Morning Show,0,The Morning Show once again fails to provide its stellar cast with compelling storylines or complex character development.
Hawkeye,0,"""Hawkeye"" is clearly more concerned with setting up Kate Bishop for future MCU phases than creating a problem worthy of two heroes' time. And at six hours, it's certainly not worthy of yours."
True Blood,0,Someone should have put a stake in this show years ago.
Star Trek: Voyager,0,"Everyone on Voyager deserved better, especially Kathryn Janeway."
Entourage,0,"Everything that went down on screen in this finale felt rushed, it was almost like no one bothered to tell the writers that they only had eight episodes this season and once they realised they had to squash episodes worth of material in to one half hour."
Entourage,0,"Once fizzy and stuffed with A-list cameos, Entourage ends on a flat note and with a recurring role for Andrew Dice Clay."
House of Cards,0,"It sounds like a compelling story, but Claire remains an icy, tough-to-read cipher through much of it, despite flashbacks to her childhood and that fourth-wall-breaking, talking-to-the-viewers thing that Spacey once did so well."
Entourage,0,"The show's best days are behind it, and the eighth-and-final-season curtain appears to be coming down none too soon."
The Wilds,0,"Overall, The Wilds is a letdown. There are some wonderful moments featuring the girls throughout the 8 episodes, but mainly you mainly just find yourself wishing the whole thing was done differently."
Players,0,Players fell short of the mark for me.
Wolverine and the X-Men,0,"Blame whatever you like- the blatant Wolverine pandering, the departure from tradition- but the interest just wasn't enough to continue the story."
Losing Alice,0,"It might have worked effectively as a 3-hour movie, but at 7 hours doled out over eight episodes, Losing Alice dribs and drabs, but mostly drabs."
Vigil,0,"According to the end credits, Vigil has been made with support from the Scottish government, which makes no secret of its opposition to nuclear weapons. That may hint at an extra political edge, but doesn't make this a compelling drama."
Moon Knight,0,"The newest MCU series on Disney+ has some interesting ideas and cool authentically Egyptian flavor, but takes its own little time to get rolling."
The Tourist,0,"What seems at the outset like a chance for Jamie Dornan to do some heavy existential lifting never quite makes good on that promise. Instead, “he Tourist”eventually settles into a conventional web of TV intrigue."
The Baby,0,"It should be weird and captivating! Instead, The Baby meanders..."
Man vs. Bee,0,There’s something dispiriting about Atkinson’s determination to play idiotic characters incapable of accomplishing routine tasks without burning down the house or ruining very valuable works of art
Dave,0,"Dave is still a biting satire set within the music industry that depicts the many pitfalls of making it to the main stage at Coachella. But especially this season, it's sometimes difficult to watch."
Game of Thrones,0,"Season 8 doesn't feel like it was earned, with too little time dedicated to growing characters paired with a greater emphasis on rushing to major plot points, rather than proving to those of us watching how inevitable they were."
Lovecraft Country,0,"The new HBO series isn't interested in torquing the qualities of what's called Lovecraftian, nor inheriting them-and its episodes are weighted down by historical annotations and clumsy exposition."
The Morning Show,0,"You've got to appreciate the moxie of a high-profile streaming series where a character blurts, ""Another streaming service? It should be illegal."" That's The Morning Show's second season in a nutshell: having its cake while choking on it."
The Pentaverate,0,"The Pentaverate rambles and repeats itself too often, even if the glimpses of Myers’ undeniable skill almost make it work and might be just enough for those who have missed him so."
Truth Be Told,0,"Unfortunately, Truth Be Told 2 does not grip at the get-go."
The Wheel of Time,0,"I never felt like I was watching an unfolding story, but I absolutely felt like I was watching the whiteboard in a writers room, more the pushing of note cards toward a destination than an adventure."
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"I'm sure there's some thought-through reason that would sound good on the page, but in practice it's a bucket of cold water on a story whose purpose is body-temperature intimacy."
Big Little Lies,0,The final episode seems to emerge from a lack of ideas about how to get these five women together again in the same room. It just doesn't work. [Full Review in Spanish]
The Office,0,"The Office definitively answers a few key questions about the cogs at the middling paper company Dunder Mifflin - if anyone out there is still interested in the once smart, now just silly sitcom."
Big Shot,0,"For a show about an ace competitor who finds joy in victory, Big Shot, stacking a canny hero against a universe of people who just don't get it, sure doesn't mind playing unfair."
Suits,0,It was about as middle of the road and predictable as to be expected from Suits.
Safe,0,"[Michael C.] Hall's accent, reasonably consistent and yet rarely believable, is one of many things on Safe that are askew and, the more I think about it, the more I can't tell if it's intentional if not particularly satisfying, or merely bad."
The Wilds,0,"The introduction of the boys is a failed experiment, and unfortunately, apart from a few good moments and an interesting finale, season 2 is a wasted continuation that offers very little."
Y: The Last Man,0,Y: The Last Man is perfectly serviceable sci-fi fare that won't move the needle too much in either direction in terms of generating controversy or inspiring awe. And that's a shame... That it settles for dull and uninspired breaks my heart.
The First,0,"Only near the very end does ""The First"" strap in for another go, after viewers have endured far too much narrative flourish."
The Affair,0,Cringeworthy: that is the only descriptor for the events that transpire throughout this episode.
Moon Knight,0,"Moon Knight, literally and figuratively, has dissociative identity disorder -- in the battle for coherent narrative, at least, and infrequently summoning the suit just doesn't cut through all that clutter."
Girls5eva,0,Despite some solid zingers... this sophomore batch of episodes feels listless.
Waco,0,Violent docudrama has unsettling depiction of cult leader.
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"There is too much time to fill, too many episodes to stretch a fairly thin plot across, and too many goddamn strangers to stay interested in any one of them."
The Baby,0,"Haphazardly careens from one idea to another, throwing in themes and plot threads that never properly fit together."
Treadstone,0,Kring still hasn't figured out that momentum isn't the same thing as complexity...
Little Fires Everywhere,0,...the series is driven by a muddle-headed and confused notion about what's wrong with the U.S...
Mr. Corman,0,I wonder with Joseph Gordon-Levitt wearing too many creative hats that he's juggling too many ideas both with the storytelling and the creative vision to keep up emotional drive within the series.
Y: The Last Man,0,"Yes, perhaps it was a rueful joke in the original comic books that the future of the male species depends upon the utterly uninteresting, immature Yorick, but here that twist is taken very seriously. The weight placed upon the character is just ludicrous."
Taboo,0,"Not even often-stunning performances... can dig Taboo out of its messy, overwrought darkness."
Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,0,"It quickly plummets into your bog-standard, formulaic Dan Brown storyline in which Langdon is a helpless prisoner of a contrived, all-constraining plot."
Tokyo Vice,0,"For all its visual pleasures, “Tokyo Vice” is guilty of sidelining its most fascinating characters. And with so many other streaming shows fighting for our attention, that’s a punishable offense."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,Has Iron Fist improved at all? The short answer: Kind of?
The First Lady,0,"The message that these women overcame barriers is hammered home, so that their heroism is never in doubt, never challenged along the way. That’s no fun."
Entourage,0,"Entourage feels awfully washed-out and washed-up, kind of like Vince Chase's dormant career, as the show counts down to the end."
Glee,0,"It's fitting, then, that the first hour ends with a Frozen cover that's over a year late to the zeitgeist... making it feel just as the show does: dull, overextended, and irrelevant. It's Glee's time-time to let it go."
Suspicion,0,"It feels like Suspicion is a bunch of espionage scenes in search of a cohesive story. The story may reveal itself at some point, but right now, the whole operation feels bland and generic."
The Pentaverate,0,"We don’t expect The Pentaverate to get much funnier as the season goes along. And the longer we watch, we think the more painfully unfunny most of the gags are going to get."
Interrogation,0,Perhaps more frustrating is that some of our time in the '80s is given to us free of a person's recollection of events.
The Crown,0,"Duty may be life and pain for the royal family. But in The Crown, it's also ultimately spiritless."
Heroes,0,"Maybe I'm coming off a little harsh, but after so many years of mediocre storytelling and promises of things being better, I'm over it."
You,0,"More and more, the show seems to be saying, Joe's struggles are just a slightly amped-up version of the viewer's own. He's ""You."" But there's too much grotesque violence in the show's past for us to relate to him, or to take the show on its own terms."
Raised by Wolves,0,Raised by Wolves wafts into emotional and narrative oblivion.
The Mandalorian,0,"Any attempt to create new characters like Werner Herzog's mysterious Client or Taika Waititi's IG-11 droid are thrown out of the window, with the makers taking the lazier step of filling the world with existing characters."
Killing Eve,0,"Weve grown accustomed to queer characters dying on screen, especially ones in relationships. Keeping these women apart for the majority of the series, giving the characters (and fans) what they want, and then ripping it away is such a tired trope."
Altered Carbon,0,"I found myself desperately wishing for Altered Carbon to leave its world of endless lives, satellite back ups, and shapeless political revolutions behind, to focus... on the AIs discarded by humanity as yet another resource to be wasted and forgotten."
Behind Her Eyes,0,"Ultimately, Behind Her Eyes has a lot of style to offer, but not much substance."
And Just Like That...,0,"I won't lie - at some level, it's nice to catch up with them. But it lacks the spark of Sex and the City. Now it's just another show."
Schmigadoon!,0,"Strong appears genuinely entertained and can hold a lovely note alongside the rest of the stage-ready cast. Still, neither the writing nor direction take advantage of the skills that Strong has honed throughout her time on Saturday Night Live."
Pieces of Her,0,"A tedious, tiresome mess that almost put me to sleep."
Monsters at Work,0,"Rather than lending fresh new eyes to a world first established two decades ago, Gannaway and company play a Greatest Hits montage of Monsters Inc. references."
Lost,0,The series squandered its final season in a misguided effort to transform its trademark narrative ingenuity into a grand metaphysical statement.
The Pentaverate,0,"That the resulting show isn’t good doesn’t especially matter, in the end. It’ll probably still find enough curious viewers to justify the partnership, and for Netflix, that’ll be more than enough."
The Stand,0,"Sadly there is very seldom any notion of stakes, of consequence, or of danger in this ultimately lifeless adaptation."
The Last Kingdom,0,"Political intrigue and historical authenticity, not to mention decent acting, gave way to romantic slush, [and] unconvincing dialogue which could never make up its mind whether it wanted to be cod-Shakespearean or yoof-friendly."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"[W]hat THE MOSQUITE COAST largely offers is an uninteresting family survival drama, with different villains introduced in each episode strictly for a reason to make the journey more gripping but add nothing meaningful."
Little America,0,"Little America is muddled, with its baked-in politics directly in opposition to its ""positive"" message."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"There is something algorithmic, machine-made about the series, as if all involved were assembled by a computer trying to simulate buzz-worthy television. Come to think of it, that might make a more interesting series."
Gaslit,0,Not even Roberts’s blistering portrayal of a woman terrorised into silence is enough to save a drama that is somehow both plodding and overreaching.
11.22.63,0,Feels like something ABC might have aired in 1997.
The Sopranos,0,One can understand David Chase's desire to have a completely unique ending... But that doesn't mean we have to like it.
Shadow and Bone,0,"There are shows that flow cohesively and others that feel like several scenes meshed together, and 'Shadow and Bone' has many lost in the mesh."
The Essex Serpent,0,"A decent production budget and starry cast led by Tom Hiddleston and Claire Danes are squandered on a dreary, convoluted, portentous drama with all the appeal of a fog blanket over a giant rotting fish which someone briefly mistook for a dead dragon."
11.22.63,0,"11.22.63 reaches some thoughtful, moving conclusions, but oh, what coulda been with a more engaged star. If only there were a time machine to fix that mistake."
Black Mirror,0,"With its move to Netflix, Black Mirror transformed from observing and satirising digital culture to becoming an active tool in some of its worst contemporary excesses."
Night Sky,0,"The show trips over its length -- Night Sky is built around a decent idea for a 100-minute movie, which it then stretches to eight hours."
Wolverine and the X-Men,0,"Ultimately, the program is reasonably good fun for X-Men aficionados, but the reliance on past movie and comic references... blunts the appeal, as does the occasionally stiff animation quality."
Joe vs Carole,0,"In practice, Joe vs. Carole feels like a brutally over-extended Saturday Night Live sketch, leaning heavily on the jokes we know and expect while clumsily trying to tease out some deeper meaning."
The Mist,0,"Okay, it's possible I'm overreacting here just a smidge. But Spike's version of The Mist is one dumb piece of work."
The Morning Show,0,"There are too many people on this show, and without exactly being sure what the series' point is, there's no way for the writers to know who to focus on. But I just know it shouldn't be the men."
The White Lotus,0,"Without a more cohesive story giving it narrative momentum, it often becomes a series of vignettes involving awful, irredeemable people who never make the right choice - and whether that's entertaining or even stomachable really depends on your mileage."
The Stand,0,"[The novel] captured a crisis through small stories that converged to form a larger reality. Had the show retained the novel's pacing, and opted for grief over gore, King's message of humanity's resilience might have carried more weight in these times."
The Wheel of Time,0,"How did Pike manage to keep up that sense of terrified, intense urgency, with all those boring plastic animals horsing around her? Where was all the swearing and off-colour shagging?"
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"Jessica's 'what makes a hero?' path this season is given plenty of heavy-handed lip service but it feels more like telling than showing, especially as Luke Cage Season 2 handled similar questions much more deftly."
House of Cards,0,"By the time the last three episodes roll around, House of Cards' final season has abruptly buried itself in a whole host of weird, borderline anti-feminist tropes."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Its story plays out the debate, but its form is firmly on Witherspoon's side. In the main, this is a show too aware of its pedigree and its importance to drive home its arguments with anything but the most earnest sort of gravity."
The Wheel of Time,0,"It does eventually bed in somewhat, but not as much as it should."
The Wire,0,"Season 5's mistakes-clunky plotting, false parallels, confused motivations-are violations of the realism the show promised."
The Beatles: Get Back,0,"Like the Beatles themselves, by the time the final episode drags itself to a close, viewers are likely to be ready, finally, to quit."
All of Us Are Dead,0,"While the diminishing returns of the shows narrative are a disappointment, the moral implications of its wide-ranging smorgasbord of social commentary are bewildering, if not outright alarming."
The Shrink Next Door,0,Herein lies the central problem with The Shrink Next Door. It's not interesting to watch someone avoid conflict.
Halo,0,The early episodes of Paramount+’s much-delayed new adaptation of the classic video game series miss their target...
The Wilds,0,"Overall, The Wilds is a letdown. There are some wonderful moments featuring the girls throughout the 8 episodes, but mainly you mainly just find yourself wishing the whole thing was done differently."
Arrested Development,0,"Coming across more like a tribute band to the series itself and ditching the controversial experimentation of 2013's Season 4, this second season of the comedy... is simply less original for a show that used to spark with cleverness."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Nine Perfect Strangers suffers from the same chronic issue that so many television adaptations of juicy novels do: it fails to capture the sneaky, get-under-your-skin tendency of its engrossing source material."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Its story plays out the debate, but its form is firmly on Witherspoon's side. In the main, this is a show too aware of its pedigree and its importance to drive home its arguments with anything but the most earnest sort of gravity."
The Office,0,Will those of us who've gradually fallen away return to see it out? I'm still not sure I will after seeing Thursday's Season 9 premiere
Twin Peaks,0,"It's hard not to feel like I've been completely, utterly duped. The two-hour kickoff did not repair the damage wrought by Season 2. If anything, it was like taking a sip of damn fine coffee after learning that someone had stuck a fish in the pot."
Glee,0,"The show ends with 121 episodes, seemingly every one a little more incoherent than the last."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,0,"There will surely be some watchable gags... but between the consistently uncertain run and a world that has seen such a substantial shift in mindset, it's safe to say that viewers are more than ready to say goodbye."
The Wheel of Time,0,"It's hard to get lost in this world when it feels so emotionally distant, so scattered, and so packed with thin plotlines."
Reacher,0,"Reacher hits all of the required beats of the story but never does it with a kinda of aplomb. There’s all the elements presented here, but there doesn’t seem to be much in the way of depth and the filmmaking leaves a lot to be desired."
Entourage,0,"""Entourage"" heads into its final eight episodes starting Sunday night and to be honest, it's time."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,0,The series fails to recognize the key to the power of its source material: its peculiarity.
The Wonder Years,0,"The old show was escapist, sure, the new one is not, but the inevitable question is why a network remakes a show in a way that largely ignores the charms of the original."
Inventing Anna,0,"In the end, both the main characters remain somewhat opaque, because they’re defined less by their specific goals than by the nebulous act of wanting."
Inventing Anna,0,"The show certainly provides indulgence (if maybe not enough for my taste). Its failure is in the framing of Delvey’s story: It’s depicted as a quasi-feminist, girlboss-adjacent revenge fantasy."
The Most Dangerous Animal of All,0,"There's a lot to like in the second half of the season, but the buy-in requires you to move through some weaker material."
The Gilded Age,0,"The Gilded Age is a feast for the eyes, and its aesthetic pleasures are undeniable -- but those are the only pleasures to be found here."
Amazing Stories,0,"I'm a fan of sci-fi anthologies, so I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of Amazing Stories in spite of its lukewarm opener episode."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,We could've developed Bucky loads more.
Inventing Anna,0,Inventing Anna feels like a ghost of a shadow of its central narrative. What’s left is a show that is so obsessed with the idea of its main character that it forgets to explore who that young woman is.
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"The fights lack any excitement, physically or emotionally. There are a couple of fights where it felt like a constant back and forth with a punch, block, repeat."
The Capture,0,"Offers a whiplash-inducing premiere that goes from, ""This is a ridiculous investigation that appears to lack a crime"" to ""How is that possible?""... A somewhat dubious premise."
Stay Close,0,"The trouble with Stay Close is that it's too familiar. Despite the plethora of unexpected twists, this series manages to feel identical to every other crime drama that's been thrown out in recent years, and not a particularly great one at that."
The Morning Show,0,"I'm not certain the show has anything to say, overall, about the news industry, about sexual abuse, about complicity, about cancel culture, or about workplace politics; so it has become one big time-filling mash of histrionics."
Stranger Things,0,"The scrappy, soulful energy that defined Stranger Things‘ early seasons has been thrown out the window, and all that’s left is a parade of ’80s movies Easter eggs and increasingly obvious plot twists."
Inside Amy Schumer,0,"Schumer is as brazen and politically conscious as ever, but this season feels less personal and less urgent than last season...and more formulaic-sometimes even bordering on lazy."
Gaslit,0,"Roberts simply feels miscast as Martha, to whom she bears no resemblance, physical or otherwise."
The Offer,0,"At 10 hours, the material is stretched absurdly thin, and it makes every flaw show."
The Beatles: Get Back,0,The Beatles: Get Back documentary proves once again that Peter Jackson's meticulous approach to filmmaking is impressive but excessive.
The Night Of,0,"Actor/producer James Gandolfini's last project was meant to be a stirring indictment of the criminal justice system. Instead, it plays like an overwrought NYPD Blue episode."
Lisey's Story,0,"Despite Moore's earnest performance, the show gets stuck in a twilight zone between hokey and horrifying. It ultimately comes to resemble a ponderous, misshapen beast, much like the one that haunts Boo'ya Moon."
Bodyguard,0,Bodyguard adds to a long and damaging media trend of depicting brown people as terrorists.
Inventing Anna,0,"Inventing Anna is a meandering and shallow take on Anna Sorokin's story, glacially paced with superfluous tangents that distract from the character we're really interested in."
Girls,0,Girls overreached. There just aren't six seasons worth of interesting material for the average millennial girl to live through without bringing in sensational elements that go above and beyond an average reality.
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Sometimes it seems to be a lampoon of New Age self-help fads; other times, an encomium to self-lacerating encounter-group culture; and occasionally, a creepy stalker drama. These are not the makings of a good jigsaw puzzle."
The Undoing,0,"The issue isn't that The Undoing tries to channel Big Little Lies, but that it does so unsuccessfully. Even in its failures, however, The Undoing made me dream of a world where TV could crack the code..."
Rise,0,"Mr. Mazzu is like Rise itself: sweet, earnest, cloying, and also obnoxious."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"Once you're in Wonderland, you might remember how dense and unfortunately dour life is there. As soon as you get there, you feel like you're ready to leave."
Arrested Development,0,"You could forgive all this if these episodes were funny, if they contained even a trace of the spark that made its first run so incredible. But they aren't. They're flat and lifeless and pointless."
Inventing Anna,0,"On screen, the story is neither salacious enough nor studied enough to bring about any concrete conclusions. Instead, it falls into its own obsessive rabbit hole, and we dont feel inclined to follow."
Coyote,0,Assembled from spare parts left over from previous television trends and decaying prejudices.
The Nevers,0,"The Nevers doesn't want for narrative, but it feels like Whedon throwing all the Buffy-lite ideas he had together ... and hoping some of it would gel."
Joe vs Carole,0,"Later in the season, Joe yells, “Nobody watches ‘Duck Dynasty’ for the ducks!” This show is all ducks."
The Twilight Zone,0,"One of the major issues of Peele's debut season was the runtime for episodes. This season is no exception, and of the three episodes screened, only one truly earns the extra half-hour - and even then, it could easily be chiseled down."
Westworld,0,"Will it all come together in a way that’s narratively sensible and emotionally satisfying? Fool me thrice, shame on me. Fool me four times, shame on Westworld."
Lisey's Story,0,"The porousness of the action becomes frustrating and, ultimately, off-putting. I don't mind being toyed with by a show; I don't need strict linearity. But the willful swirl and the withholding of coherence are too extreme here."
Halo,0,"Those of us who don’t recognise every re-enacted power-up bleep and helmet-cam vision of destruction will probably find ourselves wondering, much of the time, quite what is going on."
Defending Jacob,0,Underneath this tale... is pretty standard fare and about two hundred minutes too long.
The Problem With Jon Stewart,0,"[It] feels like Stewart's attempt to evolve what he used to do for a new era. He just hasn't figured out how to do it yet, and may be too entrenched in his old approach to succeed for anyone beyond the most die-hard Daily Show With Jon Stewart fans."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,0,"You can violate the laws of the universe you created, using a raft of new characters in whom we have no investment, or you can drag nine episodes' worth of doing so over 22 hours of TV. Not both."
The Stand,0,"Stripping this story of pretty much every shred of dramatic weight and emotional engagement is no easy task, but CBS has accomplished it"
Halo,0,"Boasting no technological innovation to speak of, few performances to offer meaningful grounding and only limited action thrills, Halo is aggressively forgettable, which is at least several steps up from “bad.”"
Big Little Lies,0,"As good as the cast was, they couldn't quite lift Big Little Lies above the ordinary."
Night Sky,0,"Night Sky begins as a beautiful coming-of-old-age story, but it splinters into an overstuffed sci-fi thriller."
Suspicion,0,"Suspicion still doesnt seem to know exactly what its saying, repurposing its more political source material into a series of middle-of-the-road thriller beats that are never as gripping as they aim to be."
Wolf Like Me,0,The first three episodes mildly intrigued me – but not enough to want to continue.
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,None of these characters speak like human beings.
Mindhunter,0,Mindhunter stumbles by linking the intimate lives of its protagonists with those of the psychopaths they interview and stalk. [Full Review in Spanish]
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,0,"There will surely be some watchable gags... but between the consistently uncertain run and a world that has seen such a substantial shift in mindset, it's safe to say that viewers are more than ready to say goodbye."
Rise,0,"... Rise feels like a rehash, a collection of stories we've already seen, presented with a slightly darker palette."
The End of the F...ing World,0,Totally disappointing. [Full review in Spanish]
The First,0,The First needs to up its game or it's headed for the black hole of oblivion.
The Morning Show,0,"There are too many people on this show, and without exactly being sure what the series' point is, there's no way for the writers to know who to focus on. But I just know it shouldn't be the men."
Night Sky,0,More of an exercise in frustration than anything else.
Rise,0,"The problem is, even with its many storylines, Rise's attempt at making the viewer a part of this small town's community, it is just too prescribed."
Amazing Stories,0,"The series might all be called Amazing Stories, But Not So Amazing That Heart Patients Can't Watch It."
Behind Her Eyes,0,Your time would be better spent reading a book. Just not the book this train wreck of a drama this based on.
Euphoria,0,"There were some great moments, but this season could have been better. You really wanted to see more for all of these characters because the actors are genuinely so talented. You don't want to see characters be pushed to the side."
Taboo,0,"Taboo is not so much a show as it is an ordeal, a slog through a miasma of squalid period clichés that's possibly even less inviting than last season's FX vanity production, The Bastard Executioner."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"The Punisher Season 2 isn't the worst season of Marvel TV on Netflix, but it's a pale shadow of its first season glory, and that's its biggest problem."
Suspicion,0,"Aside from a finale that feels notable only for its sloppiness, this thriller is about as forgettable as they come."
Little Voice,0,Never tries something original when a cliché will do instead.
Band of Brothers,0,"A glorious bungle... At times visually astonishing. Unfortunately it also suffers from disorganization, muddled thinking and a sense of redundancy."
Inventing Anna,0,"By the end, Inventing Anna may test your resolve as you decide how much time you choose to spend in the company of an unrepentant bossy narcissist, regardless of how well she’s played."
Rise,0,"Mr. Radnor is not convincing -- or he is, but in the wrong ways."
Boardwalk Empire,0,"Despite the show's relative longevity, this final season still feels like a perfunctory jump to the end, as if Winter expected Boardwalk Empire to last as long as Prohibition itself."
Waco,0,"Waco won't be the first drama to reduce a tragedy to its simplest components, but this doesn't offer much confidence that these are the right components or the only ones."
Treadstone,0,It's all a clone of the same idea. [Full Review in Spanish]
Good Sam,0,An over-emotive hospital soap opera that's even more slavishly bound by the conventions of its genre.
Killing Eve,0,"Instead of something small but perfectly formed, Killing Eve has become one of those programmes that seems mainly to inspire the response, “Oh are they still making that?”"
Y: The Last Man,0,"While some intriguing & important new elements are added, like Elliot Fletcher's trans character, the show is so concerned with big ideas it neglects all of its characters."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"Towards the end there was a 50-50 split between good and bad, but the first half or the show there was barely anything to like. A sad end for the Netflix MCU branch."
Heroes,0,"Once again, then, an error-riddled and confusingly-plotted episode of Heroes where everyone acted out of character, which, by this point, can be considered entirely consistent with their previous appearances."
The End of the F...ing World,0,"Forcing more drama onto them after they've left only feels forced. It's a lose-lose scenario, and while I'll always contend there's a good way to keep telling many stories, this isn't it."
Weeds,0,It felt like the Weeds finale could have been more focused and a bit more eventful.
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"The series isn't the surprising horror-esque piece it could be, and it doesn't offer a compelling statement on wellness or the people who buy into it. Nothing really happens at all here."
The Baby,0,The best thing about HBO’s eight-part British horror comedy The Baby is that it rarely exceeds thirty minutes per episode. The worst thing about The Baby is that it’s a TV series at all.
WeCrashed,0,"This meaty showcase for Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway is wrapped in a somewhat malnourished limited series, with the misfortune of coming at the tail end of several better productions about high-stakes startups whose founders flew too close to the sun."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Because the cast is so strong, they bring some poignancy to these roles... These are all intriguing personalities. Yet Kelley and his writing and directing team can't find a definitive lens to frame what the story is meant to convey about them."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,"Although '80s-style excess clearly accounts for much of the sizzle, this exercise feels like a no-look pass that skips out of bounds."
Bel-Air,0,"Once upon a time, Will from west Philly was miles from home, but the show he was in knew exactly what it was and where it was going. Bel-Air finds that a difficult trick to replicate."
Looking for Alaska,0,"""Looking For Alaska"" is nostalgic for itself, like it's admiring itself in a mirror instead of making eye contact. This neutralizes the immediacy and intimacy that can make coming-of-age stories so special."
Foundation,0,"It would be enjoyable if they had a bit more fun with it, but watching it felt like I was in a meeting."
Coyote,0,"Breaking Bad director Michelle MacLaren gives this series a ""Bad"" vibe, but that doesn't insure it is good... Coyote proves watchable but too derivative."
Snowflake Mountain,0,A bunch of supposed adults complaining about having to take a dump in a latrine.
Big Little Lies,0,"But by the end of season two of Big Little Lies, I not only didn't fully get what I wanted from it, I didn't feel like I got what I needed, either."
The First Lady,0,"There's never quite enough from any one first lady, which leaves a sense of disappointment. It's unfortunately a show that is lesser than the sum of its Emmy- and Oscar-winning parts."
Godless,0,"In Godless, we see a black town, literally called Blackdom, and its inhabitants as ""others..."" Think that's bad? Native American characters do not do better"
Ginny & Georgia,0,"Ginny & Georgia winds down its punishingly long first season having shouted a great deal, but said almost nothing at all."
The Alienist,0,"""The Alienist"" - which was originally critiqued for feeling behind the times and overly familiar - still plays like the worse version of so many other dramas."
His Dark Materials,0,"[Though] it's timely and relevant in places, His Dark Materials season 2 can't shake off the feeling everything it attempts has been done better elsewhere before."
Rise,0,"The messages of class disparity, a small town in an economic downturn and the power of a musical never coalesce."
Limitless,0,A good sci-fi flick forced into a generic procedural TV show.
The Baby,0,"Haphazardly careens from one idea to another, throwing in themes and plot threads that never properly fit together."
Bodyguard,0,"After a few chapters, Bodyguard does something that is as bold as it is absurd, changing all the pieces of the game, but losing all cohesion. [Full review in Spanish]"
Chernobyl,0,"We should be engaged by the tragic flaws and nobility of all this by this point, but the story and characters have gone so uncorralled that it takes all your viewing energy just to keep it fractionally straight."
Defending Jacob,0,"This limited series strains for impact. But it's unserious about the aspects of its story that are genuinely potentially interesting, and sillier than one might have any reason to expect."
The Essex Serpent,0,"Against this beautiful backdrop, the human drama never crackles. Directed by Clio Barnard, the show seems to forget that, along with all the portentous symbolism, there needs to be a spark of wit or a flicker of emotional depth."
The Essex Serpent,0,"Restrained as a corset, it feels as if The Essex Serpent doesn't want us to excite ourselves or to get any ideas beyond the ones drolly lined out for us. And that's a shame."
The Umbrella Academy,0,"This is the most apocalyptic-y apocalypse ever, but it carries no real weight. Then when you find out what has to be done to save the universe, it just feels very underwhelming. Samurais, really?"
Two and a Half Men,0,"Two and Half Men hit a new low every season and then continued to sink even further underground. During this last season, the show went off the rails in terms of absurdity and offensiveness."
The Bletchley Circle,0,"Still fun on its own terms, the encore takes an unexpected little gem and transforms it into Murder, She (and She and She and She) Wrote."
WandaVision,0,"Disney Plus's new Marvel show WandaVision promises a surreal spin on a 1960s sitcom reality. But so far, it's delivered little more than winks and nods to Marvel Cinematic Universe loyalists."
The Alienist,0,"Not a bit of the original's atmospheric quality is lost in the years that have passed between the two seasons... If the goal of Angel of Darkness is to speak to the now and make us think, however, that trail only leads to a dead end."
The Stand,0,"Sadly there is very seldom any notion of stakes, of consequence, or of danger in this ultimately lifeless adaptation."
Sharp Objects,0,"There is much to recommend Sharp Objects: its visual language is rich and fugal (blades, pigs, fans recur) and rewards close watching. But the dissatisfaction of the show's conclusion speaks to a larger confusion in the aim of the series."
Lisey's Story,0,"Lisey's Story is, on all fronts, too much. Too long, too over-produced, too many talents, too overwrought, too much going on."
Ozark,0,"More often than not, Ozarks double-crosses and shady dealings read like bullet points on a list the writers are running through, with no intrigue or connective tissue between them."
Tokyo Vice,0,"In an overabundant genre where story lines tend to follow the familiar beats of an investigation, viewers have to care about the hero. And that’s tough when his inner life is given minimal attention."
Snowflake Mountain,0,"It’s hard to determine how much of Solomon’s “personality” is genuine, but at least he provides some much-needed drama in this largely lacklustre series, which starts out so promisingly but soon peters out faster than a Gen Z doing the dishes."
The Sex Lives of College Girls,0,"We've seen better depictions of college misadventures, and while most aren't as realistically inclusive as this one, neither are their mechanics as obvious."
Sex/Life,0,"Sex/Life drowns itself in the shallow end, so to speak, by failing to even generate much heat. There are plenty of R-rated scenes-so many, actually, that they get repetitive."
Castle Rock,0,"In this misguided series, the clash between grounded psychological horror and bump-in-the-night monster mania delivers fewer shivers than shrugs of confusion."
Naomi,0,"Moves in slow motion, feeling like a conventional high-school drama with just a pinch of superheroics provided to pull the audience along."
Hannibal,0,It's difficult to love a show that seems to be trying to hard to be impenetrable to viewers to the point that it's practically begging to be canceled with such uninviting storytelling.
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Elena is thinly drawn as an obviously villainous ""white savior"" and Witherspoon is repeating her performance from Big Little Lies with less nuance and shading."
The Stand,0,"As rendered in this iteration of King's epic, that mix of realism and fantasy results in a disjointed, tonally inconsistent work that manages to both over-condense aspects of the original saga and overstay its welcome."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"If the plotting and the characters in The Mosquito Coast were more compelling, it wouldn't matter as much that Cross has ignored virtually every element of his source material."
The Act,0,Watch Mommy Dead and Dearest as well as the various interviews with Gypsy Rose Blanchard instead; they'll be a lot more fascinating to watch than The Act.
Y: The Last Man,0,"t takes the swashbuckling, humorous tone of the source material and trades it in for a generic end-of-the-world ominousness that makes it seem like a forgotten season of The Walking Dead."
Snowflake Mountain,0,"In this instance, hate the show, not the contestants, and what we learn is that just when you think Netflix won’t go lower, it certainly will."
Black Mirror,0,"The fifth series of Black Mirror is comprised of episodes that feel less like the work of Brooker and more like thin, wanting knock-offs that were inspired by him."
The Office,0,"Sorry, Dunder Mifflin, I might come back for your going-out-of-business sale (or whatever constitutes a not-so-grand finale), but for now, you're in fourth position in this time period once everything kicks into gear next week."
Midnight Mass,0,"They could have just gone so much further with... the mysticism, the miracles, and even the backstories of these characters."
Prison Break,0,This was most definitely not the way I wanted nor expected season five to get underway. But here's hoping somehow the show is able to catch its footing because Ogygia was a complete and utter letdown.
A Wilderness of Error,0,"""A Wilderness of Error"" offers a not-so-illuminating message that it's sometimes difficult to get at the truth that's not worth the five hours it takes to hear it."
Inventing Anna,0,"Despite its more evocative performances, Inventing Anna demands patience that doesn’t pay off, squandering its promising potential along the way."
The Undoing,0,"The issue isn't that The Undoing tries to channel Big Little Lies, but that it does so unsuccessfully. Even in its failures, however, The Undoing made me dream of a world where TV could crack the code..."
Limitless,0,"Limitless comes off as rote, slick and bloodless.The show is based on the film of the same name and expect occasional Bradley Cooper drop-ins, but unless Limitless lives up to its name and starts achieving far more of its potential, I'll pass."
Killing Eve,0,"Instead of something small but perfectly formed, Killing Eve has become one of those programmes that seems mainly to inspire the response, “Oh are they still making that?”"
Bel-Air,0,It takes every aspect of the original show and sucks out the joy.
Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,0,"It quickly plummets into your bog-standard, formulaic Dan Brown storyline in which Langdon is a helpless prisoner of a contrived, all-constraining plot."
Glee,0,"While the new kids at McKinley get a few quirky gags, they feel half-hearted, as if only real remaining mission is to follow our old friends to the finish line. That's fine. But we could have done it two seasons ago and not missed much."
Mare of Easttown,0,"It's nice that HBO has turned out another handsomely produced, manifestly serious mini-series for the wonderful actress Kate Winslet. It would be nicer if those series were worth her time and talent."
Forever,0,"The show tries to combine the more typical tropes of a marriage sitcom with the more supernatural ones it introduces with this higher concept twist, to muddled effect."
The Good Wife,0,"The finale was littered with non-conclusions, contradictions and plain old absurdities."
Gossip Girl,0,"A few good characters caught in a terrible TV show, desperately trying to escape."
Safe,0,Safe isn't without its ticking clock grittiness and compelling riddles but there's also unintended comedy involved with a story where everyone somehow unwittingly contributes to someone's dire demise.
The Shrink Next Door,0,"Though the performances are uniformly terrific -- Ferrell has to walk the highest tightrope, making Marty believable but not too pathetic -- The Shrink Next Door is Exhibit A in streaming series bloat. There's not enough story to justify eight episodes."
Turner & Hooch,0,"One difference between the film and the series - and it's a pretty significant one - is that Josh Peck is no Tom Hanks. Another difference - again, pretty significant - is that it's not 1989 anymore."
The Sopranos,0,One can understand David Chase's desire to have a completely unique ending... But that doesn't mean we have to like it.
Our Flag Means Death,0,Our Flag Means Death proves to be too droll for its own good.
The Right Stuff,0,"The actors do their best to overcome the flat writing, and the show does find its stride by the fifth episode. What the new ""Right Stuff"" is missing are the qualities it can probably never have: currency and context."
Sharp Objects,0,"The lead performance by Amy Adams as troubled reporter Camille Preaker keeps the show mostly watchable, but it's a chore to get through the dead-end subplots and the slow trickle of narrative developments that surround her."
The Morning Show,0,It's baffling how a series with such a talented and star-studded cast managed to bypass prestige drama and land in the realm of soap opera.
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,The problem: Danny Rand is just not compelling enough to carry his own show.
Naomi,0,"Moves in slow motion, feeling like a conventional high-school drama with just a pinch of superheroics provided to pull the audience along."
Glee,0,"It's fitting, then, that the first hour ends with a Frozen cover that's over a year late to the zeitgeist... making it feel just as the show does: dull, overextended, and irrelevant. It's Glee's time-time to let it go."
Big Little Lies,0,"But by the end of season two of Big Little Lies, I not only didn't fully get what I wanted from it, I didn't feel like I got what I needed, either."
Brave New World,0,"Sadly, beyond those genre departures that seem like, let's be honest, products of inconsistent tone in the show's writing and direction, Brave New World doesn't offer much."
Gaslit,0,"If the series accomplishes nothing else, it’s guaranteed to teach a few audience members stories they didn’t know before. It’s just too bad that in its messiness, Gaslit stops somewhere short of doing them justice."
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"You end up wondering whether they are true soulmates, or just trauma-bonded beyond redemption. Christ, you think, move on, but, alas, they won't."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,0,"[It] feels like Stewart's attempt to evolve what he used to do for a new era. He just hasn't figured out how to do it yet, and may be too entrenched in his old approach to succeed for anyone beyond the most die-hard Daily Show With Jon Stewart fans."
Inside Amy Schumer,0,"There are jokes about what it means to be an everyday woman, but they're sprinkled in among jokes about what it must be like to be Amy Schumer, and it messes with the voice of the show."
Waco,0,"What Waco needs, and fails to achieve, is a complex, unified theory of Koresh."
The Afterparty,0,"If you're a fan of Haddish or anyone else involved, I'd recommend you look for your yuks elsewhere. Billed as a genre-defying murder mystery, the only thing this tone-deaf pastiche-fest defies is a reason to be seen."
Ginny & Georgia,0,"Ginny & Georgia wants us to love the way that Georgia always manages to stay one step ahead... Instead, I kept hoping that Child Protective Services would finally catch up."
True Detective,0,"The towering talent of Ali almost straightens out the third season of True Detective from its ultimately dull centrifugal swirl. Yet,[it's] is overwhelmed by... capricious leaps in time and thinly spread philosophical space"
The O.C.,0,"As is perhaps fitting, though, for a show about teenagers and their notoriously short attention spans, the writers found it hard to keep up the momentum and the quality took a dive... It has been clear the show is on its last legs."
The Morning Show,0,"""The Morning Show"" keeps returning to this idea that even as the network is drowning an endless pool of scandal and drama, these people care. I don't know if that's supposed to be meaningful or ironic, but mostly it left me feeling nothing at all."
This Is Going to Hurt,0,"It’s akin to watching an episode of “Grey’s Anatomy” or “Chicago Med” or “New Amsterdam” or “The Resident” et al., only spread out over seven episodes instead of a 44-minute storyline."
Shadow and Bone,0,Shadow and Bone could use some intimacy! Its conflicts as currently written are way too big and too abstract; its characters are too generic and undefined.
Night Sky,0,"Despite strong performances by Simmons and Spacek, this series just plods along with only mildly entertaining bits of story."
The Pentaverate,0,"Returning to the prosthetics and puns that helped make Austin Powers a classic was an inherent risk, but it might have been worth it with better writing."
Fargo,0,"Fargo has always been a little off-kilter, but those elements stand out as particularly indulgent or egregious this season, when its overall storytelling approach is so uneven."
The Pentaverate,0,"The Pentaverate rambles and repeats itself too often, even if the glimpses of Myers’ undeniable skill almost make it work and might be just enough for those who have missed him so."
Loot,0,"While it has plenty of funny moments, it’s a hard pill to swallow to muster much sympathy for a character that literally has everything she wants."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,There are several bizarre gaps in the shows structure.
Loot,0,"It’s only thanks to Rudolph’s ability to balance winsomeness, befuddlement, and sincerity that Molly isn’t utterly infuriating, and even with that in mind, Loot overestimates how much of the character viewers will be willing to tolerate."
Girls,0,Girls overreached. There just aren't six seasons worth of interesting material for the average millennial girl to live through without bringing in sensational elements that go above and beyond an average reality.
Prison Break,0,This was most definitely not the way I wanted nor expected season five to get underway. But here's hoping somehow the show is able to catch its footing because Ogygia was a complete and utter letdown.
Inside Amy Schumer,0,"There are jokes about what it means to be an everyday woman, but they're sprinkled in among jokes about what it must be like to be Amy Schumer, and it messes with the voice of the show."
The Wheel of Time,0,"While there is enough violence and faux-mysticism to keep genre fans happy, convincing human interactions are harder to find."
The Affair,0,The Affair Season 5 Episode 1 was a colossal waste of time.
The Morning Show,0,"""The Morning Show"" has become such a media object of fascination, I think, not just because the odds were so heavily stacked in its favor, but because it ultimately squanders so much of its potential."
11.22.63,0,"If Stephen King could go back in time, maybe he'd decide to stop selling his books to television."
Brave New World,0,"Both Brown Findlay and Ehrenreich seem frustratingly tamped-down here... No wonder the actors seem exhausted; their project, deep into its first season, doesn't know what kind of show it wants to be."
Foundation,0,"Foundation has no evident limitations of any kind, yet no real visceral impact for the most part, because it's almost stultifyingly dull, especially in its middle episodes."
The Wheel of Time,0,You know what? I think the screen version might be even worse than the book.
Casual,0,"Somehow... the series keeps from being overwhelmed by all the changes, either to its characters or the world around them, and winds up in delivering an emotionally satisfying end to one of Hulu's most charming and enjoyable series."
Boardwalk Empire,0,"Every minute spent in Cuba drags the pacing to a crawl, even by this show's pacing standards."
Vigil,0,"According to the end credits, Vigil has been made with support from the Scottish government, which makes no secret of its opposition to nuclear weapons. That may hint at an extra political edge, but doesn't make this a compelling drama."
Bridgerton,0,"Theres something to be said for familiarity, but Bridgerton keeps most of the less interesting stuff from last season and jettisons the scandalous intrigue we tuned in for in the first place."
The Thing About Pam,0,The Thing About Pam offers an intriguing but tonally off-putting rehash of a familiar true crime story.
Amazing Stories,0,"The show seems to be an intentional throwback, trading on Spielberg nostalgia to draw those who recognize the original, or just its family-friendly appeal, into Apple's orbit -- but it comes off more dated than deliberately retro."
The Morning Show,0,"The plot became a haphazard mess, motivations were mysterious, no two storylines tied together, and the cast foundered. Saying it was off the rails was an insult to train derailments everywhere."
Night Sky,0,"Sissy Spacek and J.K. Simmons are powerhouses here, delivering poignant performances, and even carrying the weight when the show spirals into numbing nonsense."
Moon Knight,0,"The 1st episode is fantastic, but the quality quickly drops off.  Steven is fun but Isaac makes the other personality, Marc, quite boring. Moon Knight & his mythology are sloppily defined,  making it hard to get excited about this new addition to the MCU."
The End of the F...ing World,0,Totally disappointing. [Full review in Spanish]
The Office,0,Will those of us who've gradually fallen away return to see it out? I'm still not sure I will after seeing Thursday's Season 9 premiere
All of Us Are Dead,0,It's delivered in an oddly-paced season that fights against an intuitive structure as much as these students try to beat back chomps from throngs of kids in uniforms.
Brave New World,0,"It spends so much time reveling in its own aesthetic that dramatic momentum becomes an afterthought. At the same time, there are real ideas contained within the nine-part series. Some of them are actually in the book."
Taboo,0,[Taboo] silently bullies you into a reverence it probably doesn't deserve.
Euphoria,0,"It's the prevailing tone, at once nasty and tedious, that I loathe; watching the show, my mood hovers somewhere between boredom and dread."
Stranger Things,0,"In the end, it isn’t growing up that threatens the unstoppable rise of Netflix’s great homegrown hit. It’s a refusal to let go of what no longer serves it."
Outer Range,0,Measuring most shows against the masterful Twin Peaks feels unfair. But Brian Watkins’ Outer Range baldly baits the comparison—sometimes with success but more often to his show’s detriment.
Rise,0,"When Rise shifts focus to one of Robbie's big games, it becomes painfully apparent how effortlessly Friday Night Lights stirred the emotions Rise struggles to find. It's not until the season finale that the show realizes its full tear-jerking potential."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"The best part about 9 Perfect Strangers is that the Wikipedia entry states up top ""not to be confused with Perfect Strangers."" Oh, how I wish that this were the tale of 9 Balkis..."
The X-Files,0,"A lot of the return to night is devoted to chase scenes and makes one appreciate by comparison how much better a reboot ""Twin Peaks"" was last year."
The Staircase,0,"Campos brings visual panache to the project, but can never quite surmount the old aphorism that truth is stranger than fiction."
House of Cards,0,"It isn't easy to replace Frank Underwood, who... has become one of the most legendary characters ever portrayed on a TV show. However, it is obvious that this season not only lacked inspiration - it was lacking, in general."
Brave New World,0,"[Brave New World] could have gone in any wild direction it wanted, but it opted for a take that feels like the safest possible outcome."
Catastrophe,0,Co-creators Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney still inhabit their roles with almost frightening conviction. But I do feel that enough will be enough in a few weeks' time.
The Alienist,0,"""The Alienist"" - which was originally critiqued for feeling behind the times and overly familiar - still plays like the worse version of so many other dramas."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,0,"In its first episode, The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers resembles its scrappy kids: uneasy on the ice and a little afraid to take shots."
Brave New World,0,"This adaptation looks great but is definitively hollow, and in turn all of its parties, extensive discussions, and choreographed orgy scenes become simply exhausting."
Sharp Objects,0,"Adams is good, ""Sharp Objects"" is deadly slow."
The Right Stuff,0,"Approach it simply as Hunky Young Astronauts in Love rather than a Wolfe adaptation... like the movie, it still can't find time to dedicate a full episode to NASA's test monkeys - and you might even be able to dispense with some of the disappointment."
Looking for Alaska,0,"""Looking For Alaska"" is nostalgic for itself, like it's admiring itself in a mirror instead of making eye contact. This neutralizes the immediacy and intimacy that can make coming-of-age stories so special."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,What’s left is a show filled with so much hatred and ickiness it’s hard to believe anyone will find something to enjoy lurking inside all this muck.
The Wilds,0,"Overall, The Wilds is a letdown. There are some wonderful moments featuring the girls throughout the 8 episodes, but mainly you mainly just find yourself wishing the whole thing was done differently."
Community,0,"The last season of Community was really, truly awful. I mean, it crashed and burned. And for a show as self-aware as this one, there's no way it didn't know it."
Girls,0,It's unlikely anything will be fully formed - characters or tone - by the end of the final episode. Girls will stay frustrating.
The Office,0,Will those of us who've gradually fallen away return to see it out? I'm still not sure I will after seeing Thursday's Season 9 premiere
13 Reasons Why,0,"13 Reasons Why was frustrating and difficult, but it's over, and there will be no looking back."
Angelyne,0,I liked “Angelyne” better as it went on... without ever being wholly convinced that it was a trip I needed to take.
Mr. Corman,0,"Mr. Corman is billed as a ""comedy,"" somehow, but it's missing the laughs. It seems to be going for cringe comedy, but we just end up cringing. I felt more sad watching it than anything."
The Book of Boba Fett,0,The Book of Boba Fett is beyond even an experiment. It should be a bellwether for future writers and producers – because it takes us all for granted.
The Pentaverate,0,A profoundly unfunny series of sex and poop jokes.
And Just Like That...,0,Introducing a cross-section of different types of recurring characters -- love. Feeling like the series creators had a checklist of representation token boxes to check off... it's all trying way too hard -- hate.
Invasion,0,Invasion proceeds so incrementally across such a wide range of characters and their responses to extraterrestrial terrorism that you might well lose your way from week to week. Never mind your interest.
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,"Some of these scenes are watchable, good even - but they kill the pace during the series' already-flabby hour-long episodes, and leave you longing for a simpler story without the padding."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,0,"The final season was a chance for the show to engage in some systemic critique; its attempts to do so, however, largely fell flat... A soft-pedaled version of policing and the people who do it."
Glee,0,"It's fitting, then, that the first hour ends with a Frozen cover that's over a year late to the zeitgeist... making it feel just as the show does: dull, overextended, and irrelevant. It's Glee's time-time to let it go."
Taboo,0,The series itself dives into bewildering sojourns through memory. . .or is it fantasy?. . . showing tribespeople with painted faces and bizarre asides in which James whispers in unfamiliar tongues to unseen forces.
Lovecraft Country,0,"The show inadvertently simplifies the realities of white supremacy with its monster allegory, while treating the Black cast less as characters in their own right and more as vehicles for a sweeping critique of American racism."
The First,0,Packed with corny symbolism and inexplicable cutaways.
The First Lady,0,"For all its glossy production values and talented leads, a few episodes in The First Lady starts to show fatigue, like three highly padded made-for-TV movies spliced together."
Turner & Hooch,0,"One difference between the film and the series - and it's a pretty significant one - is that Josh Peck is no Tom Hanks. Another difference - again, pretty significant - is that it's not 1989 anymore."
The Offer,0,The depictions of real-life actors border on mimicry... The various Mafia personages appear to have watched The Godfather once too often.
The Mist,0,"Like King's last TV series, ""Under the Dome,"" ""The Mist"" would seem to have a short shelf life. One hour with these people and you'll be rooting for the critters."
The First Lady,0,"For all its glossy sheen and good intentions, The First Lady has little to offer that feels truly, meaningfully “real.”"
Pieces of Her,0,The latest example of a miniseries that long overstays its welcome.
The Twilight Zone,0,"CBS All Access' reboot of The Twilight Zone rarely beats the audience at the guessing games it poses, or when it does, the twist is so basic as to be barely worth scoffing at."
The Fall,0,"If Season 3 is the last season of Netflix's The Fall, it went out on a strange note."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"Jessica's 'what makes a hero?' path this season is given plenty of heavy-handed lip service but it feels more like telling than showing, especially as Luke Cage Season 2 handled similar questions much more deftly."
Waco,0,"What Waco needs, and fails to achieve, is a complex, unified theory of Koresh."
Bridgerton,0,Season 2 timidly skimmed the surface of such representation when I needed it to leap into sumptuous storytelling. I couldn’t escape into it while I was also trying to navigate its unsatisfying approach to inclusivity.
The Staircase,0,"To call The Staircase a docu-series is a gross exaggeration. It is filmed entirely from the perspective of Peterson's team, an overwrought exploration of a self-involved family."
Lovecraft Country,0,Lovecraft Country wears its progressivism like a costume.
The Undoing,0,It was a bumpy flight that wound up in a dingy parking lot.
Behind Her Eyes,0,It opts for a bizarre shock that's baffling at best and deeply tone-deaf at its worst.
The Staircase,0,"True crime is not something to be toyed with, and The Staircase, for all the beautiful work put into it, toys with viewers instead of finding the salient truths about the case."
A Teacher,0,It takes its sweet time getting anywhere and it's not an engaging trip. Both Ms. Mara and Mr. Robinson create characters who are sympathetic but also uninteresting; neither provides a reason to hang on.
Why Women Kill,0,"The ensuing lurid shenanigans are cartoonish to a campy extreme, and it's hard to care who'll end up killing whom in their venal, petty squabbles."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,0,"Any attempt to reboot The Mighty Ducks shouldn't be undertaken lightly. The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers, unfortunately, tackles the franchise with all the grace and nuance of the Bash Brothers."
Inventing Anna,0,The result falls flat. Inventing Anna is a stretched-out nine-episode romp that never quite catches the enigma of its protagonist -- or matches her appeal.
The Summer I Turned Pretty,0,"The series is striving to capture that feeling of first love, of growing up and finding your own path. There’s moody music, hazy photography, and characters in slow motion. And yet, none of it quite works."
Rise,0,"The messages of class disparity, a small town in an economic downturn and the power of a musical never coalesce."
Inventing Anna,0,"Inventing Anna is a meandering and shallow take on Anna Sorokin's story, glacially paced with superfluous tangents that distract from the character we're really interested in."
Reacher,0,"Reacher hits all of the required beats of the story but never does it with a kinda of aplomb. There’s all the elements presented here, but there doesn’t seem to be much in the way of depth and the filmmaking leaves a lot to be desired."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Its story plays out the debate, but its form is firmly on Witherspoon's side. In the main, this is a show too aware of its pedigree and its importance to drive home its arguments with anything but the most earnest sort of gravity."
The Wilds,0,"The end result is a season that is overstuffed and yet drags, as though the boys sucked all the energy out of the first season, as they do."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,Why are we coming back to all these people again?
Shining Girls,0,Too many threads are left dangling or unexplained. You never get that satisfying feeling of everything clicking into place by the end.
The Gilded Age,0,The fact that Julian Fellowes has a done a lot of research for this will be appreciated by a lot of people and especially for those who love his stuff. For others they may find it a yawn-festlike I did.
Amazing Stories,0,Those tuning in expecting to see the director's light touch and clever manner of engaging our emotions will be disappointed: The show's first installment feels less like a revival than a holdover.
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,The true scandal is how lazy it all feels.
Fringe,0,"At some point, Fringe kind of fell in love with change for its own sake, and it wandered away for long periods from what powered its finest moments - the complex bonds among Olivia, Peter and Walter."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"I can only speak for myself, but I don't have the patience for this anymore. At least Breaking Bad had the decency to make Walter White a tame family man before he went gonzo."
Suspicion,0,Suspicion is a show consistently filled with incident it can sometimes trick you into thinking it is complex.
Safe,0,"Safe could have been so good. All the ingredients were there for a prime binge-worthy crime thriller - the writers, the cast, the concept - but it just hasn't been given the time, care and attention it needed."
A Teacher,0,"At a time when TV embraces inventive and risky storytelling, ""A Teacher"" looks and feels like something that belonged on cable 10 years ago."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"If we wanted to watch a show that's relentlessly grim, there are much better choices out there."
Star Trek: Picard,0,"While it starts strong, and it's focus on recontextualizing trauma remains earnestly admirable, the season ultimately doesn't have enough story to propel its 10-hour runtime, leading to meandering plots that rely more on nostalgia then storytelling."
The Good Wife,0,"The finale was littered with non-conclusions, contradictions and plain old absurdities."
The Boondocks,0,The thrill is gone.
The Alienist,0,"The dialogue is stodgy and the mystery nowhere near as gripping as TV's other show about a mom falsely accused of her child's murder, Perry Mason. But it's just good enough, and you can't beat the period atmosphere."
The Mist,0,The Mist unfolds as though we'll be surprised to learn that humans are capable of cruelty.
Suspicion,0,There’s not enough substance or character development here to hold our attention beyond the time it takes to click “NEXT.”
WeCrashed,0,Apple TV's first high-profile letdown doesn't know whether to satirise WeWork founder Adam Neumann or to idolise him.
Inventing Anna,0,"There is a brilliant drama to be had from the story of Anna Delvey, and when someone makes one I’ll be sure to let you know."
Lovecraft Country,0,Lovecraft Country links to literary racism simply for fake topicality. Anti-American nihilism and hopeless racial cynicism give the show its gotcha.
Coyote,0,"Breaking Bad director Michelle MacLaren gives this series a ""Bad"" vibe, but that doesn't insure it is good... Coyote proves watchable but too derivative."
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"I'm sure there's some thought-through reason that would sound good on the page, but in practice it's a bucket of cold water on a story whose purpose is body-temperature intimacy."
Limitless,0,"Maybe the show will improve when it kicks into the case-of-the-week format and ramps up the nonsensical effects of this mysterious pill, but I don't have high hopes."
Inventing Anna,0,The result falls flat. Inventing Anna is a stretched-out nine-episode romp that never quite catches the enigma of its protagonist -- or matches her appeal.
House of Cards,0,"House of Cards never quite maintains momentum, again; the first five episodes sent to critics are sometimes promising, sometimes plodding."
Rick and Morty,0,Season 5 of Rick And Morty is worryingly uneven for the cartoon that breathed new life into the medium.
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,"Bloated, disheveled story but a super soundtrack and performance by Reg E. Cathey."
Game of Thrones,0,"[This season] made choices that I just didn't understand...you have to wrap it up somehow, and this season is just full of more extremes and it just doesn't work anymore or fit in with the rest..."
The Twilight Zone,0,"As with most anthology series, the results are decidedly mixed. For one thing, the show does away with its social justice bent entirely at a time in which those stories would be most welcome."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,One crucial departure from the formula is the writing.
Twin Peaks,0,Lynch's twisted brutalization of women likewise continues... It all seems to be part of the director's basic playbook. And it's past time for him to be called out on it.
Two and a Half Men,0,"I swear to God, I don't think I could come up with a worse ending."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"I had the same uneasy reaction to the podcast itself, and I bailed on Shrink early, in both incarnations. But hey, there's obviously an audience for this."
Bel-Air,0,"Suck all the joy, exuberance and wondrous charisma out of “The Fresh Prince” — a worthy launchpad for an actor who, in his prime, was widely considered the biggest movie star in the world — and you’re left with the gloomy and plodding “Bel-Air.”"
The Morning Show,0,"There are too many people on this show, and without exactly being sure what the series' point is, there's no way for the writers to know who to focus on. But I just know it shouldn't be the men."
The Afterparty,0,"An Apple TV+ comedy series with one murder, plenty of suspects and minimal intrigue -- the sort of show that's modestly entertaining but doesn't bring enough to the party."
The Undoing,0,"While The Undoing strings together just enough surprises to keep viewers interested episode-to-episode, its writing and direction are both muddled, making for an occasionally unpleasant viewing experience."
Squid Game,0,"The greater anticapitalist critique of Squid Game almost entirely toothless following any serious analysis...I am unimpressed with the messaging, and am confident this drama won't stand the test of time."
11.22.63,0,Feels like something ABC might have aired in 1997.
The Afterparty,0,"If you're a fan of Haddish or anyone else involved, I'd recommend you look for your yuks elsewhere. Billed as a genre-defying murder mystery, the only thing this tone-deaf pastiche-fest defies is a reason to be seen."
Moon Knight,0,"Flashes of brilliance offer a glimpse of the more introspective, imaginative show we were promised, and the finale has the opportunity to deliver. As it stands, though, Marvel Studios' latest Disney+ outing is also its most disappointing."
Bodyguard,0,"Unfortunately, full of filler where there should be thriller, Bodyguard just can't get the job done, literally or figuratively."
The Affair,0,Cringeworthy: that is the only descriptor for the events that transpire throughout this episode.
The Fall,0,"If Season 3 is the last season of Netflix's The Fall, it went out on a strange note."
Peacemaker,0,"With Cenas undeniable charisma and a cast willing to play along with every insane scenario, theres quality moments. Its too bad that Gunn kept forcing chaos on a team and a series that would have benefited from a bit less ofwell, everything."
Amazing Stories,0,"Some twists, mystery in tame but lackluster anthology."
Brave New World,0,"The constant writhing of beautiful bodies isn't enough to keep the interest in a show with a plotline as thin as ice. Lazy writing with no engaging qualities leaves this one, one tough pill to swallow."
The Pentaverate,0,"There are rare parts of The Pentaverate that demonstrate how Mike Myers' brand of humor can still feel fun and fresh here in 2022, but too much of it proves the opposite."
11.22.63,0,"11.22.63 reaches some thoughtful, moving conclusions, but oh, what coulda been with a more engaged star. If only there were a time machine to fix that mistake."
The First,0,"Only near the very end does ""The First"" strap in for another go, after viewers have endured far too much narrative flourish."
The Boys,0,The series’ ideology feels increasingly hollow.
Gossip Girl,0,"With age comes wisdom? Whoever said that should have passed the memo to the Gossip Girl gang, because after six seasons, they're still as clueless as ever."
Bel-Air,0,"It’s one thing to ask whether it would be great if the Fresh Prince premise was used in service of a grittier, more dramatic take on the story; it’s another to make that twist work over the long haul."
Invincible,0,"Invincible has the potential to become a better show, but only if the makers move beyond this adolescent mockery of a superhero series and into a zone of mature storytelling. The ingredients are already there. The mixing needs to be better."
Lost,0,"The series, which started with so much promise, stalled some time in its third season and will now be remembered as a monstrosity that fused kitsch to camp."
11.22.63,0,"I'm still not entirely convinced about 11.22.63 just yet. While I have always enjoyed Franco as an actor, I'm not getting the sense of conviction that I got from book-Jake."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Masha's a megalomaniac who can't help playing god when given the chance. But she feels increasingly generic as the series chugs along, flattening from a female Keith Raniere to a life-size cardboard cutout of him."
Y: The Last Man,0,Y: The Last Man is perfectly serviceable sci-fi fare that won't move the needle too much in either direction in terms of generating controversy or inspiring awe. And that's a shame... That it settles for dull and uninspired breaks my heart.
Sex/Life,0,A Road Runner cartoon has more sophisticated characterisations.
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"If the series had scaled back some of its theatrics to be more subtle, I think it would've packed a much harder punch. I don't need characters screaming at each other every other scene; I need them to be saying something of interest."
The Nevers,0,"If The Nevers does get to continue, having someone else in charge could be the special power it really needs."
The Big Conn,0,"The Big Conn bites off plenty, and occasionally more than it should chew, distending its scope to the point that it loses sight of Conn, whose over-the-top brazenness is the most interesting aspect of this saga."
Ginny & Georgia,0,"Unfortunately, the show's ambitions for bigger stakes mean trading in some of the character-based intimacy that is the series' calling card. Go big or go home, they say - but Ginny & Georgia makes a strong case for staying cozy."
Mr. Corman,0,It's disingenuous for [Joseph Gordon-Levitt] to try to get in the mind of the average man who doesn't know what he wants to do.
The Mosquito Coast,0,"If the plotting and the characters in The Mosquito Coast were more compelling, it wouldn't matter as much that Cross has ignored virtually every element of his source material."
Chernobyl,0,"We should be engaged by the tragic flaws and nobility of all this by this point, but the story and characters have gone so uncorralled that it takes all your viewing energy just to keep it fractionally straight."
Invasion,0,Invasion proceeds so incrementally across such a wide range of characters and their responses to extraterrestrial terrorism that you might well lose your way from week to week. Never mind your interest.
The Wheel of Time,0,"The action, when it comes, is lively, if predictable, but The Wheel of Time buckles under chunks of tedious exposition."
True Blood,0,"In its final season, the series seems to have exhausted its stores of surprises."
Joe vs Carole,0,"Though it's based on the Wondery podcast that first broke the tawdry tiger tale in 2019, Joe vs. Carole simply doesn't contain enough fresh insight to justify its existence today  despite game performances by the stars."
WandaVision,0,"It feels empty and aimless, like the writers wanted an avenue to play with the TV eras, but didn't think hard enough about how to make WandaVision independent of the past."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"The show depends to a large degree on our knowing that this crazy thing really did happen, kinda sorta in this way. At the same time, with all such adaptations, it is cramped by that dependency..."
The Essex Serpent,0,"Despite its riveting source material, The Essex Serpent ends up being a gothic bore. Even the charms of Tom Hiddleston can't save this one."
Good Sam,0,I'm as game as the next fan for a new House. This just isn't there yet.
Mad Men,0,"Gone are the days of ""Zou Bisou Bisou"" and Don's Hawaiian mortality freak-out. Nope. This season premiere, all we got was a cold pastrami sandwich with coleslaw smeared on the bread."
Snowflake Mountain,0,"Despite what the title may suggest, there’s nothing all that incendiary or political about Snowflake Mountain. And unlike a snowflake, there’s nothing unique about it either."
Big Shot,0,"Big Shot, while perfectly amiable in most respects, often fails to sweat the details in the way that a tough coach would demand."
Lisey's Story,0,"Lisey's Story is pretty to look at and fairly faithful, but far too bloated to be very engaging."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,An incredibly frustrating story that never quite brings all of its ideas home.
Brave New World,0,"As it unfolds, ""Brave New World"" fits only the most nebulous sense of the word ""interesting,"" with its most relevant commentary left behind in the Savage Lands."
The Mist,0,The Mist unfolds as though we'll be surprised to learn that humans are capable of cruelty.
Archive 81,0,"At eight episodes it's way too long. And though they're attractive, the two leads are not much more than serviceable in the acting department."
What If...?,0,"A galaxy-level cast, for a TikTok-level Disney+ series. [Marvel's] first animated series [...] allows it to operate on a different canvas [but] the first three episodes don't push the envelope. What If...? feels like a footnote in the MCU encyclopaedia."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"The show depends to a large degree on our knowing that this crazy thing really did happen, kinda sorta in this way. At the same time, with all such adaptations, it is cramped by that dependency..."
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"The first time it happened, I thought I'd pressed play on a behind-the-scenes special. By the time episode three rolled around, I started shouting 'No!' at the telly."
Foundation,0,"As with some of Apple's other high budget series, the desire to look massive overtakes a lean narrative... This is probably the priciest slow burner show ever made."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,0,"However, season seven took this farther than it had to, losing the series' signature comedy and making it feel more like a chore to watch week to week than anything else."
Bridgerton,0,Bridgerton season 2 is a lackluster season that hopes to recapture the heights of its first but mostly falls short.
Foundation,0,"Not much about Foundation sticks, either emotionally or narratively. There are cause-and-effect relationships between one event and another, but they're stretched across long-attenuated frames."
The Alienist,0,"""The Alienist"" - which was originally critiqued for feeling behind the times and overly familiar - still plays like the worse version of so many other dramas."
True Detective,0,True Detective falls prey to a slightly milder case of misogyny than afflicted it in season one.
The X-Files,0,"And if you are not already a fan, there is no good reason to watch Season 11. The opening episode verged on soap opera, bloated with cringey dialogue and breathy conspiracies."
True Blood,0,"I won't go so far as to say that True Blood's limping into its final season, but it's definitely anemic."
Inventing Anna,0,"As watchable as the show can be, one cant help but see the better version lurking beneath the surface. Ultimately, iInventing Annai misses the point of what made Delveys story a viral sensation."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"It would, at this point, take a truly inspired interpretation to make a Time Traveler’s Wife series work. Sadly, this ain’t it."
Waco,0,"The intimate humanization of Koresh and his followers comes across as a pure defense, a vindication of the rights of fringe groups to exist with huge stockpiles of guns without attracting the eye of law enforcement."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"A paint-by-numbers thriller that ostensibly investigates the nature of sexual consent without really making us feel invested in any of the characters involved, however well-acted."
The Alienist,0,"The dialogue is stodgy and the mystery nowhere near as gripping as TV's other show about a mom falsely accused of her child's murder, Perry Mason. But it's just good enough, and you can't beat the period atmosphere."
Marvel's Hero Project,0,"The real-world stories are inspiring enough. The framing device, in which the word ""Marvel"" is pronounced as often as is (slightly more than) seemly, is a distraction that feels like self-promotion."
X-Men,0,Frankly - and it pains me to say this - it would be better if the final season of X-Men: The Animated Series didn't exist at all.
Vikings: Valhalla,0,"Valhalla isn’t terrible. But it feels mostly like more of the same, without having much of an identity to itself. In a crowded landscape, that doesn’t give it a lot to fight for."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"[W]hat THE MOSQUITE COAST largely offers is an uninteresting family survival drama, with different villains introduced in each episode strictly for a reason to make the journey more gripping but add nothing meaningful."
Behind Her Eyes,0,"Here's my general opinion: I like a good twist, but the twist in Behind Her Eyes is a groaner. The series switches genres, and the final chapter felt to me like a slap in the face -- when it didn't make me laugh out loud at the absurdity."
Big Shot,0,"If you're over ten years old, you've seen everything here before."
Behind Her Eyes,0,Your time would be better spent reading a book. Just not the book this train wreck of a drama this based on.
Killing Eve,0,"Like many Peak TV plots, this one could have been resolved fifteen episodes ago. One senses the fatigue in the narrative with the very tone of the first episodes."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"The series rapidly hops between decades but feels like it moves at a crawl, dulling the myriad charms of its leading cast."
After Life,0,"Treated with a little more care, I suppose all of this could be saying really interesting things about male failure and loneliness. It's lazy, though. No idea or message is ever pursued. Nothing is."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,0,"While I was happy to see Estevez on screen, the character is flat and unpleasant, giving little explanation about his backstory until episode three."
Defending Jacob,0,"Defending Jacob suffers greatly from its format, stretching 120 minutes of story max into eight hours of episodic television."
The Stand,0,"If you don't stand for something, you end up looking like a Walking Dead spin-off that never made it to the air."
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"You end up wondering whether they are true soulmates, or just trauma-bonded beyond redemption. Christ, you think, move on, but, alas, they won't."
Foundation,0,"Spanning a millennium and juggling at least half-a-dozen narratives at any given moment, Foundation is suitably epic to behold, but has the emotional intensity of a lecture on particle physics."
The Book of Boba Fett,0,"The episodes had little to offer. And when they ran out of Fett's past and present, The Book of Boba Fett simply ditched him and switched over to Din Djarin."
The Beatles: Get Back,0,"There is a point, about five hours in, when the prospect of hearing another ramshackle version of Don't Let Me Down becomes an active threat to the viewer's sanity."
Ozark,0,"The tension all goes slack, formerly compelling characters end up being waved at each other like wooden dolls, and yet another prestige drama leaves the audience wondering why they bothered."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"Once Upon a Time in Wonderland is a disappointment, focusing more on the chintzy tableau of the candy-colored Wonderland than on giving its actors anything interesting to do there."
The Offer,0,"What unremarkably ensues is a kind of broad and tacky Godfather cosplay with zero subtext, nothing to say and very little to aspire to other than telling an increasingly self-satisfied tale of how The Godfather was made."
Girls,0,It's unlikely anything will be fully formed - characters or tone - by the end of the final episode. Girls will stay frustrating.
Sex and the City,0,"I got to wondering: didn't we reach a climax in our relationship with Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda sooner than any of us would dare to admit?"
Normal People,0,"I kept yearning for these mouthwateringly beautiful people to be more convincingly nasty to each other, for the romance to take on palpable energy, fizz, danger, real sadness."
Friends,0,"Even the kiss that cemented Ross and Rachel couldn't disguise the show's larger anti-climax, a cop-out from the logical conclusions of the show's premise, conclusions it began to acknowledge only to ultimately deny their existence."
Foundation,0,"For people who know or are fans of Isaac Asimov and his work, I feel compelled to warn you that if you watch the show you will see a scene so enraging that you will tear your TV in two with your bare hands."
Prison Break,0,This was most definitely not the way I wanted nor expected season five to get underway. But here's hoping somehow the show is able to catch its footing because Ogygia was a complete and utter letdown.
The First,0,Packed with corny symbolism and inexplicable cutaways.
Queer as Folk,0,"Queer as Folk always felt dangerous and interesting, as if we were peeking in on a world we shouldn’t. The reboot feels jaded, as if we are watching things we’ve seen a hundred times before."
Foundation,0,"I find myself less enthusiastic about spending hours watching a series gear up for the good stuff, especially when the material is as sombre as this."
Shadow and Bone,0,"There are shows that flow cohesively and others that feel like several scenes meshed together, and 'Shadow and Bone' has many lost in the mesh."
Defending Jacob,0,The worst thing about Apple TV+'s new limited series Defending Jacob is that it feels like every other crime series we've seen before.
Marvel's The Punisher,0,Why are we coming back to all these people again?
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"It would, at this point, take a truly inspired interpretation to make a Time Traveler’s Wife series work. Sadly, this ain’t it."
Prison Break,0,"Once the thrill of becoming reacquainted wears off, you're left with a somewhat muddled, not at all credible yarn."
Inventing Anna,0,Ends up feeling like a show-length adaptation of a novelty T-shirt that reads ANNA DELVEY DID NOTHING WRONG in big block letters.
Invincible,0,"But both the jokes and the character beats that fuel Invincible are too sporadic to make the series feel anything more than sputtering. Unassailable, it is not."
Loot,0,The greatest crime of Loot is how much it fails its leading lady.
The Beatles: Get Back,0,The Beatles: Get Back documentary proves once again that Peter Jackson's meticulous approach to filmmaking is impressive but excessive.
Foundation,0,"Foundation has no evident limitations of any kind, yet no real visceral impact for the most part, because it's almost stultifyingly dull, especially in its middle episodes."
Teen Wolf,0,"This finale felt like more of a cliffhanger than anything the show has done before, which is a strange choice when writing the series finale. I don't love knowing that there's a huge war to be fought and that's where all these people are going."
Behind Her Eyes,0,It opts for a bizarre shock that's baffling at best and deeply tone-deaf at its worst.
WeCrashed,0,"Boy howdy if it doesn’t match former WeWork CEO Adam Neumann pound-for-pound on crappy decision-making, hapless showmanship, and missed opportunities to get back to basics."
The Right Stuff,0,"The Right Stuff is not bad, or even boring, just thin and unconvincing."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,An incredibly frustrating story that never quite brings all of its ideas home.
Devs,0,"Of course the characters don't have free will. That would require imagination, something Devs can only simulate."
The Gilded Age,0,HBO hired Julian Fellowes to make a Downton Abbey out of 1880s NYC. But all the fussy costumes and jewelry in the world can’t bring The Gilded Age’s story of old vs. new money to life.
Y: The Last Man,0,"t takes the swashbuckling, humorous tone of the source material and trades it in for a generic end-of-the-world ominousness that makes it seem like a forgotten season of The Walking Dead."
Mad Men,0,"With each new season, I try to remind myself that the show is a slow burn. The first episode wasn't as glacial as the first episode of last season, but it still dragged a bit."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,...the series is driven by a muddle-headed and confused notion about what's wrong with the U.S...
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"I'm sure there's some thought-through reason that would sound good on the page, but in practice it's a bucket of cold water on a story whose purpose is body-temperature intimacy."
Midnight Mass,0,"Had it been a 90-minute movie, Midnight Mass could pass as innocuous entertainment. But lasting seven hours, this is nothing more than an unfortunate waste of time. [Full Review in Spanish]"
BoJack Horseman,0,[T]he decision to split up the sixth and final season makes these episodes a deeply unsatisfying experience.
The Stand,0,"The Stand is a shockingly inept adaptation of Stephen King's most beloved properties. Nearly every creative choice is bad - from bland characters, to stilted dialogue, to glacial pacing. It's just so boring."
Suspicion,0,"Based on the Israeli series False Flag, the show devolves into a strange hybrid that’s neither tense nor particularly logical."
Stranger Things,0,Season 4 was a 13-hour-plus behemoth that added Wes Craven to its mood board but otherwise ended with undeveloped characters and obvious but superficial allusions to contemporary crises.
Inventing Anna,0,"In the end, both the main characters remain somewhat opaque, because they’re defined less by their specific goals than by the nebulous act of wanting."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"There is too much time to fill, too many episodes to stretch a fairly thin plot across, and too many goddamn strangers to stay interested in any one of them."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"No expense was spared in building sets and procuring costumes that make the socioeconomic details of this story come through crisply, but both characters are, in the end, ciphers."
Mr. Corman,0,It's disingenuous for [Joseph Gordon-Levitt] to try to get in the mind of the average man who doesn't know what he wants to do.
Big Little Lies,0,"The series works best when it focuses on intimate, human moments rather than on broad social critiques."
The Mysterious Benedict Society,0,"The first two episodes have a start-and-stop energy, with more tests leading to more tests, and it gets more and more tedious."
Limitless,0,"It's not heavy-handed and it doesn't dumb down its audience (although you do have to buy into the NZT brainpower stuff), it just feels like it's missing something, and I think that something may be a level of investment in the characters."
Inside Amy Schumer,0,"Schumer is as brazen and politically conscious as ever, but this season feels less personal and less urgent than last season...and more formulaic-sometimes even bordering on lazy."
House of Cards,0,"The final eight episodes, which are all available for streaming now on Netflix, comes to a messy conclusion with more loose ends than a Florida election ballot."
The Mist,0,Making sense of this mess is probably impossible and not worth the effort.
Treadstone,0,"While the action in Treadstone is great, there just isn't enough plot to make a satisfying watch."
After Life,0,"Monologues about grief and recovery are painfully trite, painfully single-dimensional; it falls short of even syrupy fare like Ted Lasso."
Inventing Anna,0,Ends up feeling like a show-length adaptation of a novelty T-shirt that reads ANNA DELVEY DID NOTHING WRONG in big block letters.
The Afterparty,0,How does something with such sparky potential come to feel so strangely flat?
Stranger Things,0,The timing is terrible. The show itself gets slightly better from there.
You,0,"More and more, the show seems to be saying, Joe's struggles are just a slightly amped-up version of the viewer's own. He's ""You."" But there's too much grotesque violence in the show's past for us to relate to him, or to take the show on its own terms."
The First Lady,0,"The Showtime miniseries, starring Viola Davis, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Gillian Anderson, manages to make life as a White House wife seem both cosmic and forgettable."
Black Sails,0,"Though there are hints of better things to come, the early goings of Black Sails season 4 are light on fun and adventure."
Arrested Development,0,"Unfortunately for the show, even without the controversies putting a cloud over proceedings, the simple fact of the matter is that this season just isn't that good."
Halo,0,"Boasting no technological innovation to speak of, few performances to offer meaningful grounding and only limited action thrills, Halo is aggressively forgettable, which is at least several steps up from “bad.”"
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"This update brings the star power of Jessica Chastain and Oscar Isaac, but can't match the emotional intensity of the original."
WeCrashed,0,
The Man Who Fell to Earth,0,The Man Who Fell to Earth is like the worst kind of tech bro -- it doesn’t offer anything innovative enough to actually live up to its own hype.
The Endgame,0,"It all looks quite sleek and impressive, but even after just two episodes, Elena’s ability to pull off the impossible out of nowhere begins to get old."
And Just Like That...,0,"And Just Like That... isn't nearly as clever, funny or as interesting as it thinks it is."
The Nevers,0,There are a lot of other shows more worthy of investing your time in.
The Night Of,0,"Everyone else, whether in jail, court, or the police station, is a variation on a character portrayed more distinctively in other TV shows."
Two and a Half Men,0,"I swear to God, I don't think I could come up with a worse ending."
The Book of Boba Fett,0,"The episodes had little to offer. And when they ran out of Fett's past and present, The Book of Boba Fett simply ditched him and switched over to Din Djarin."
Rise,0,It's time for a break from the tears. You have to earn those.
WandaVision,0,"The end product is comedically wan, the double-takes broad and all the Olsen/Bettany/Hahn charm squeezed into tiny dabs of screen time"
Scandal,0,"Looking back, the real Scandal was that anyone kept watching."
Suspicion,0,"This viewer simply lost the patience waiting for the show to allow Thurman, a gifted performer who too rarely gets the chance to let loose these days, to do much of anything."
The Pentaverate,0,A profoundly unfunny series of sex and poop jokes.
Snowflake Mountain,0,"Despite what the title may suggest, there’s nothing all that incendiary or political about Snowflake Mountain. And unlike a snowflake, there’s nothing unique about it either."
Twin Peaks,0,Lynch's twisted brutalization of women likewise continues... It all seems to be part of the director's basic playbook. And it's past time for him to be called out on it.
Lisey's Story,0,"Apple's Stephen King Miniseries Starts Off Strong, Only to Quickly Fall Apart."
Prison Break,0,"There's a reason the phrase ""You can't go home again"" amounts to a cliché. You really can't. Especially when home is a prison."
The Afterparty,0,How does something with such sparky potential come to feel so strangely flat?
Foundation,0,"""Foundation"" has the space for Asimov's seemingly endless plot points to breathe. Even so, it's much to take in, though creators David S. Goyer and Josh Friedman deserve kudos for making the effort at achieving the impossible."
Marvel's Hero Project,0,"The real-world stories are inspiring enough. The framing device, in which the word ""Marvel"" is pronounced as often as is (slightly more than) seemly, is a distraction that feels like self-promotion."
Pieces of Her,0,"Toni Collette never misses, but shes left stranded here by a script that doesnt go far enough to provoke B-movie thrills and is structured in a way that drains anything that feels realistic."
The Afterparty,0,"The Afterparty squanders the talents of its cast with a broad, derivative and annoyingly obnoxious screenplay."
Scandal,0,"Looking back, the real Scandal was that anyone kept watching."
The Morning Show,0,It's clear that whoever is writing the loaded conversations between these characters has never participated in one of their own to learn that this is simply not how we talk about any of it.
BoJack Horseman,0,"I've faithfully followed BoJack Horseman from its beginning, and have frequently found it quite funny and fitfully touching, but as time goes on I find it more difficult to fully embrace the show as a meaningful work."
The Afterparty,0,"While it will elicit a chuckle or two, The Afterparty relies too much on stereotypes and your existing attachment to the actors. Despite a clever premise, it's let down by weak writing and an over reliance on experimental storytelling devices."
The Nevers,0,"The Nevers may get better when Whedon is no longer involved. It also may not. As it stands, the show is airing proof that Whedon's former proficiency, which insulated him from experiencing the consequences of his disturbing actions, has vanished."
The White Lotus,0,"If you like rich, self-absorbed bores whining and wittering among themselves, fantastic."
Friends,0,"The ""Friends"" soap opera ended predictably and blandly last night, with no big surprises, just two little ones -- Monica's and Chandler's twins."
Pieces of Her,0,"Toni Collette never misses, but shes left stranded here by a script that doesnt go far enough to provoke B-movie thrills and is structured in a way that drains anything that feels realistic."
Prison Break,0,The nostalgia works against the show.
Rise,0,"Rise is not the next Friday Night Lights, or even the next great teen drama. It's more like Friday Night Lite."
The Baby,0,"It should be weird and captivating! Instead, The Baby meanders..."
Joe vs Carole,0,"In practice, Joe vs. Carole feels like a brutally over-extended Saturday Night Live sketch, leaning heavily on the jokes we know and expect while clumsily trying to tease out some deeper meaning."
Amazing Stories,0,When this ending comes the audience may wish they'd have watched something more exciting instead.
Joe vs Carole,0,"Coming out a full two years after the cultural rubbernecking that made Netflix’s Tiger King a brief sensation, the show’s refusal or inability to streamline the themes and narrative of this story has gone from innocuous to grievous."
24,0,Live Another Day feels terribly dated.
The Stranger,0,"In lieu of a single, compelling premise, its mystery is a web of disparate threads, which not only makes it plot-heavy but prevents any real character development."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"The creative choice to provide little to no backstory severely dulls the show's impact. The Mosquito Coast remains just a surface-level, sepia-toned thriller about a family on the run, mostly to coax the vanity of its patriarch."
The Pentaverate,0,"While I am glad I didn’t have to pay to see this on the big screen, I enjoyed laughing at some dumb jokes for a couple of hours."
Invasion,0,Invasion is a slog - and not a particularly enjoyable one at that.
Shameless,0,Shameless fails many of its other characters when it comes to their conclusions. The series even does it in such a way where it feels like the show made a deliberate choice to avoid giving a solid ending to anyone's arc.
Bel-Air,0,"It’s one thing to ask whether it would be great if the Fresh Prince premise was used in service of a grittier, more dramatic take on the story; it’s another to make that twist work over the long haul."
House of Cards,0,"It sounds like a compelling story, but Claire remains an icy, tough-to-read cipher through much of it, despite flashbacks to her childhood and that fourth-wall-breaking, talking-to-the-viewers thing that Spacey once did so well."
Star Trek: Picard,0,"While it starts strong, and it's focus on recontextualizing trauma remains earnestly admirable, the season ultimately doesn't have enough story to propel its 10-hour runtime, leading to meandering plots that rely more on nostalgia then storytelling."
Friends,0,"The ""Friends"" soap opera ended predictably and blandly last night, with no big surprises, just two little ones -- Monica's and Chandler's twins."
The OA,0,"Events, characters and half-formed ideas are thrown at the screen then abandoned in favour of fresh mysteries, the show infinitely rolling out a carpet of kookiness."
The First,0,"For a show about people looking up to the stars in wonder, its gaze is disappointingly earthbound."
Minx,0,It feels like a real missed opportunity that “Minx” is so unwilling to question its own assumptions: that porn is good; that feminism must be fun; and that capturing the White female moneyed gaze is the ultimate marker of the magazine’s success.
Veep,0,The cast of Veep is so abject that it is one-dimensional. [Full review in Spanish]
The Mosquito Coast,0,"The show's skittish unwillingness to look hard at its characters for longer than a monologue dooms it -- not to failure but to a sort of absence, making a show about people in the fight for their lives feel like something to have on in the background."
Pieces of Her,0,"While a new Collette performance is an event, the show often seems to be hiding its most effective onscreen asset, in favor of time spent in the past. And that past likely worked better on the page than onscreen."
Moon Knight,0,"As much as I enjoyed watching Marc and Steven argue with each other in some Gollumesque fashion, I kept getting lost when the storyline switched from one character to the other."
Snowflake Mountain,0,"Part reality competition and part train wreck, this is a formulaic series produced to make its cast look pathetic."
Succession,0,"I come not to bury ""Succession"" nor to praise it, but to perpetually hope it will take up that messy space between paranoia and performative nonchalance."
Loki,0,"The idea of Loki bouncing around history and stirring up trouble is more than enough ammo for a series, but Loki makes the bizarre choice of bogging itself down under layers and layers of bureaucracy."
You,0,"For a thriller that was previously known for dealing largely in shock value, Joe's actions - accompanied once again by his over-indulgent inner monologue - now start to wear thin to the point of becoming predictable."
The Stand,0,"As rendered in this iteration of King's epic, that mix of realism and fantasy results in a disjointed, tonally inconsistent work that manages to both over-condense aspects of the original saga and overstay its welcome."
The Morning Show,0,The Morning Show once again fails to provide its stellar cast with compelling storylines or complex character development.
Treadstone,0,Treadstone... just treads a lot of narrative water.
The Wheel of Time,0,What frustrates me is from the outset of The Wheel of Time is that it does that thing where it spends five minutes quickly explaining a world you dont know with terminology you have never heard or really understand.
Big Little Lies,0,"The series works best when it focuses on intimate, human moments rather than on broad social critiques."
The Crown,0,"Sadly, what we get here from the Peter Morgan-created series is substantially tweaked timelines and substandard soap that is far less ""character"" and more live-action spitting image caricature."
Schmigadoon!,0,"After having borrowed quite so heavily from traditional forms, the show only haltingly and gradually, and without much of the help that the neglected Key and Strong might have provided, arrives at something that can stand on its own."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"The creative choice to provide little to no backstory severely dulls the show's impact. The Mosquito Coast remains just a surface-level, sepia-toned thriller about a family on the run, mostly to coax the vanity of its patriarch."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"Fox's delusions grow to the point where it's sometimes hard to believe what's happening, and it makes less of a statement about consumerism and the dangers of a free market than it, as I said already, does the Walter White thing in a misfired manner"
The Mosquito Coast,0,"The creative choice to provide little to no backstory severely dulls the show's impact. The Mosquito Coast remains just a surface-level, sepia-toned thriller about a family on the run, mostly to coax the vanity of its patriarch."
The Expanse,0,"The season feels incomplete, an insufficient and far too economical kiss off for such an intricately constructed show. It's sad to see a world built with the breadth of the universe have no room to breathe."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,0,A series that started out a heartbreaker ends in a shrug.
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"The Time Traveler's Wife focuses so much on the time travel element, it fails to build the relationship between the lead characters, which should be the heart of the series."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"The Time Traveler's Wife focuses so much on the time travel element, it fails to build the relationship between the lead characters, which should be the heart of the series."
Two and a Half Men,0,"Buddy, your show's been on for 12 seasons. Don't you want to send off your characters in any type of meaningful way? Nah. Let's just use the time to get back at someone for something people have long forgotten about."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"What's frustrating about Little Fires Everywhere is that the discrepancy between the novel and the miniseries implies that A-list actors are all the show has to offer, when what should really shine is Ng's wise, haunting story."
Limitless,0,"Maybe the show will improve when it kicks into the case-of-the-week format and ramps up the nonsensical effects of this mysterious pill, but I don't have high hopes."
The Book of Boba Fett,0,"Disney left its content farm out in Tatooines suns for far too long, a wilted mess of a commodity masquerading as a television show. What a sad showing, not just for Star Wars, but for art itself."
The Office,0,Will those of us who've gradually fallen away return to see it out? I'm still not sure I will after seeing Thursday's Season 9 premiere
Outer Range,0,A lot of people do good work on “Open Range.” If only it provided a little more to hold onto.
House of Cards,0,"The story picks up on the 4th of July, but it hardly feels like a birthday party with so much repetitive plotting and counterplotting going on."
The Mist,0,"To basically every character in The Mist, allow me to paraphrase the hero of the movie version of a different Stephen King novella: Get busy being better written, or get busy dying."
Behind Her Eyes,0,"Here's my general opinion: I like a good twist, but the twist in Behind Her Eyes is a groaner. The series switches genres, and the final chapter felt to me like a slap in the face -- when it didn't make me laugh out loud at the absurdity."
Bridgerton,0,"82 million Netflix account holders can’t be wrong, can they? Well, yes. Yes, they can."
The X-Files,0,"I honestly can't tell whether or not Mulder's dialogue is supposed to sound ridiculous (in the second episode he utters this baffling phrase: ""Scully, you looked so adorbs"")."
Interrogation,0,Perhaps more frustrating is that some of our time in the '80s is given to us free of a person's recollection of events.
The First,0,"Providing all the attendant pageantry and triumphant music and inspirational speeches you might expect, before shifting back to the glummest, slowest, least enthusiastic approach possible to the material."
Amazing Stories,0,"This show should have been a home run. In my opinion the missed opportunity lies in three areas: the story, the pacing and the direction."
The Crown,0,"Duty may be life and pain for the royal family. But in The Crown, it's also ultimately spiritless."
Peacemaker,0,"With Cenas undeniable charisma and a cast willing to play along with every insane scenario, theres quality moments. Its too bad that Gunn kept forcing chaos on a team and a series that would have benefited from a bit less ofwell, everything."
Roar,0,All the starry turns and strong performances can’t make this anthology series cohere into a show that has something to say about contemporary womanhood.
The Pentaverate,0,Little more than a cheap excuse for Myers to put on some prosthetics and do silly voices
The First,0,"The show has a bland, sanitized feel, no matter how hard its cheesy score tries to heighten the inspiration at every turn. The best sci-fi stories, underneath the robots and space flights, are great human stories."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"A dour, flavorless combination of familiar crime-drama elements, led by Renner at his most glum."
Prison Break,0,The not-so-good news about Prison Break is that the suspension of disbelief it requires is simply a bridge too far.
The First,0,"For a show about people looking up to the stars in wonder, its gaze is disappointingly earthbound."
The Gilded Age,0,HBO hired Julian Fellowes to make a Downton Abbey out of 1880s NYC. But all the fussy costumes and jewelry in the world can’t bring The Gilded Age’s story of old vs. new money to life.
Lisey's Story,0,What's on screen can be bloated and exasperating. But Stephen King's eight-hour version of his favorite among his own scary novels can-thanks to stars Julianne Moore and Clive Owen-pull you up short with the beauty and terror of marriage.
The Morning Show,0,"These cobbled together histrionic dramatics are offensive compared to the gravity of the issues of the first season. Even combined, the desperate scrambles of the second season don't have enough bite, or credibility, for the viewer to invest in."
After Life,0,"Hardcore fans of the show - which are legion - will mourn its passing, but for the rest of us, Gervais's maudlin curio remains a kind of purgatory."
The Shrink Next Door,0,Mainly what held my interest in The Shrink Next Door was the myriad reasons it doesn't quite work.
The Afterparty,0,"While it will elicit a chuckle or two, The Afterparty relies too much on stereotypes and your existing attachment to the actors. Despite a clever premise, it's let down by weak writing and an over reliance on experimental storytelling devices."
11.22.63,0,Feels like something ABC might have aired in 1997.
The Pentaverate,0,"Underneath its mildly amusing, emotionally scattered exterior, The Pentaverate is a flawed but heartfelt ode to the importance of honesty in an era where lies are widespread and popularized."
And Just Like That...,0,Nothing about the show feels organic; so much about it is painfully forced.
Man vs. Bee,0,"Imagine Parasite, if Parasite was the worst thing you’d seen in your life."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,0,"It's a noble ambition, but one that surely Stewart must realize precious few viewers will stick around for without some jokes to leaven the proceedings."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"As it nears the end of its run, the series doesn't seem to have much more to say about trauma."
Star Trek: Prodigy,0,"The show mostly just transparently trades off the ""Trek"" title without feeling like it's going anywhere, boldly or otherwise."
The Wheel of Time,0,"How did Pike manage to keep up that sense of terrified, intense urgency, with all those boring plastic animals horsing around her? Where was all the swearing and off-colour shagging?"
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"The Time Traveler’s Wife is so unsatisfying, it’s a bit baffling why anybody, let alone Steven Moffat, whose work as a writer and showrunner includes Doctor Who and Sherlock, decided to have a go at it."
The Offer,0,"There's some good and bad with this... but at a certain point, you think ""Why am I watching a miniseries about The Godfather when I could be watching The Godfather?"""
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"If only time travel were real, they could use it to go back and do it right."
First Kill,0,"As a cheesy teen soap with supernatural elements, First Kill holds some promise, but that quickly dissipates as the eight-episode season progresses."
Foundation,0,The individual parts of this Foundation equation add up to something that's very pretty and slightly dull. Asimov's books have long been considered impossible to adapt. This version is a noble effort that can't quite solve the problem.
The Essex Serpent,0,[The greater concepts] are squandered for the mundane banality of the people in this town.
Star Trek,0,"Season one changed the genre as we know it, and the second season equally so; it's just a crying shame that the third couldn't have made it a hat trick."
Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area,0,"Basically, it reuses everything that gave personality to the [original] Spanish series and presents us with a copy instead of with an adaptation. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Alienist,0,"""The Alienist"" - which was originally critiqued for feeling behind the times and overly familiar - still plays like the worse version of so many other dramas."
The Pentaverate,0,"We don’t expect The Pentaverate to get much funnier as the season goes along. And the longer we watch, we think the more painfully unfunny most of the gags are going to get."
Godless,0,"If genre cliches are brought into a work to be deconstructed, but said cliches remain stylized and centered, then what's actually being upended in this process?"
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,It's not only that Kelley has gussied up the average Californian spa menu in such a way that everything seems silly rather than satirical. The more he lays on the mysteries and the secrets... the less compelling it all feels.
Mr. Corman,0,"Mr. Corman, the new AppleTV+ series from Joseph Gordon-Levitt suffers from a number of issues, not least of which is an uninteresting lead character."
Safe,0,"It can whirr on, in its mechanical way, without me."
Amazing Stories,0,"The upside of any anthology series is the possibility that the next installment can completely turn things around with a brand-new tale. Still, if this is the show's best foot forward, it doesn't imply much optimism."
The Offer,0,"While The Offer is an intermittently entertaining fictionalization about the making of the greatest movie of all time, your time would be far better spent re-watching the greatest movie of all time and the greatest sequel ever."
Westworld,0,"Will it all come together in a way that’s narratively sensible and emotionally satisfying? Fool me thrice, shame on me. Fool me four times, shame on Westworld."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"[Mayor of] Kingstown, written by Sheridan, is another muscular soap that's long on characters talking in indecipherable lingo and short on clarity."
And Just Like That...,0,"And Just Like That... is a massive departure from Sex and the City in all the worst ways. It trades in its wit for a humorless, tone-deaf sequel series that struggles to make any case for its existence."
Shining Girls,0,"Moss is obviously a draw, but even she can only do so much with thin and confusing material."
Entourage,0,"Once fizzy and stuffed with A-list cameos, Entourage ends on a flat note and with a recurring role for Andrew Dice Clay."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,The story fails to convince that the couple shares much more than an understanding of the obstacles keeping them apart. So much time is spent on establishing the rules of this show’s game that there’s little room to play.
The Night Of,0,A show like this one is so busy saying something about the justice system and the prison-industrial complex that it rarely has a moment to consider that one of the injustices here is that a person was killed.
The Offer,0,"While The Offer is an intermittently entertaining fictionalization about the making of the greatest movie of all time, your time would be far better spent re-watching the greatest movie of all time and the greatest sequel ever."
Brave New World,0,"Sadly, beyond those genre departures that seem like, let's be honest, products of inconsistent tone in the show's writing and direction, Brave New World doesn't offer much."
Outer Range,0,"Outer Range has one of the worst momentum problems I've ever seen in a streaming show, squandering an evocative setting and some fun twists on portentous take-forever storytelling that prioritizes hints over character depth."
True Blood,0,"I won't go so far as to say that True Blood's limping into its final season, but it's definitely anemic."
Moon Knight,0,"...audiences that are looking for a unique and dynamic approach to one of the more unorthodox heroes in Marvels repertoire, Moon Knight is a disappointment."
Godless,0,"It shows, in a bad way, that the original material was designed for a short film format, and you can tell that there was no script to fill the more than seven hours that the miniseries lasts. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Behind Her Eyes,0,"The empty characterization isn't egregious, but it seems like an apparatus that's been built around some hidden central engine the show doesn't want to reveal. Why are these people like this?"
The Nevers,0,There are a lot of other shows more worthy of investing your time in.
And Just Like That...,0,"Nearly a quarter of a century later, And Just Like That affirms that Carrie, Charlotte and Miranda failed to mature into women any sane person would want to spend time with, let alone to grow up to be."
The Queen's Gambit,0,"It is a show that takes itself so seriously that, when former child actor Thomas Brodie-Sangster turns up dressed like an escapee from the Wild West, you don't know whether it's meant to be funny or not"
Glee,0,"The show ends with 121 episodes, seemingly every one a little more incoherent than the last."
Star Trek: Picard,0,"While it starts strong, and it's focus on recontextualizing trauma remains earnestly admirable, the season ultimately doesn't have enough story to propel its 10-hour runtime, leading to meandering plots that rely more on nostalgia then storytelling."
Roar,0,"Mostly the stories hammer you over the head with their obviousness, then peter out."
The Pentaverate,0,"The Pentaverate rambles and repeats itself too often, even if the glimpses of Myers’ undeniable skill almost make it work and might be just enough for those who have missed him so."
Prison Break,0,"There's a reason the phrase ""You can't go home again"" amounts to a cliché. You really can't. Especially when home is a prison."
The Office,0,"Sorry, Dunder Mifflin, I might come back for your going-out-of-business sale (or whatever constitutes a not-so-grand finale), but for now, you're in fourth position in this time period once everything kicks into gear next week."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"In Anatomy of a Scandal, there is the matter of what constitutes consent and what is rape. But the muddled storytelling leaves the victim behind."
Sex/Life,0,"Whatever inherent truths the show explores -- marriage is hard, the magic/romance fades, etc. -- get overshadowed by the wanton silliness."
Arrested Development,0,"Arrested Development, which was once, easily, one of my favorite comedies of all time, has become a reanimated corpse that I'd like to see dead and buried."
The Right Stuff,0,The Right Stuff is inoffensively bland.
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"[Mayor of] Kingstown, written by Sheridan, is another muscular soap that's long on characters talking in indecipherable lingo and short on clarity."
Behind Her Eyes,0,It opts for a bizarre shock that's baffling at best and deeply tone-deaf at its worst.
Vigil,0,"According to the end credits, Vigil has been made with support from the Scottish government, which makes no secret of its opposition to nuclear weapons. That may hint at an extra political edge, but doesn't make this a compelling drama."
Sharp Objects,0,"The lead performance by Amy Adams as troubled reporter Camille Preaker keeps the show mostly watchable, but it's a chore to get through the dead-end subplots and the slow trickle of narrative developments that surround her."
The First Lady,0,"While it celebrates women who break the mold, the show itself is deeply — and dispiritingly — conventional."
Stranger Things,0,"The whole experience felt like being forced to eat every menu item from the Cheesecake Factory over the course of a day: lots of deliciousness, some things you never wanted, and the whole experience leaving you feeling nothing but bloated."
The Beatles: Get Back,0,"Like the Beatles themselves, by the time the final episode drags itself to a close, viewers are likely to be ready, finally, to quit."
Moon Knight,0,"As much as I enjoyed watching Marc and Steven argue with each other in some Gollumesque fashion, I kept getting lost when the storyline switched from one character to the other."
Invasion,0,"It's sophisticated, visually excellent, but doesn't quite hit the mark. [Full Review in Spanish]"
True Detective,0,"A thin story spread over a lot of hours, but Ali is excellent and so is his support."
Loki,0,"The series achieves its ultimate manifestation as Saturday-afternoon animation. With Loki, Marvel, Disney, and their die-hard constituents have found ways to make the banal even more banal."
Safe,0,Safe isn't without its ticking clock grittiness and compelling riddles but there's also unintended comedy involved with a story where everyone somehow unwittingly contributes to someone's dire demise.
Defending Jacob,0,All the ingredients are in place to make Defending Jacob one of the year's best shows. Instead it's an average outing into an already crowded medium. And that's kind of indefensible.
Night Sky,0,"After that first hour, you may be holding back tears. But after seven more, your eyes have glazed over, and even these luminous stars can’t bring you back to Earth."
The Fall,0,"This show thinks it is Very Important Viewing, unmissable drama, televisual literature. The fact is it's very missable indeed."
The Act,0,Watch Mommy Dead and Dearest as well as the various interviews with Gypsy Rose Blanchard instead; they'll be a lot more fascinating to watch than The Act.
The Undoing,0,The Undoing becomes overly long and formulaic. It's less interesting than Big Little Lies and has less on its mind socio-politically than Little Fires Everywhere.
The Pentaverate,0,Little more than a cheap excuse for Myers to put on some prosthetics and do silly voices
Bridgerton,0,"Theres something to be said for familiarity, but Bridgerton keeps most of the less interesting stuff from last season and jettisons the scandalous intrigue we tuned in for in the first place."
Lovecraft Country,0,"Rather than weaving the elements of the show together to buttress each other, Lovecraft Country simply piles up a bunch of horror tropes for no discernible reason."
You,0,"For a thriller that was previously known for dealing largely in shock value, Joe's actions - accompanied once again by his over-indulgent inner monologue - now start to wear thin to the point of becoming predictable."
Halo,0,"Between the series’s somewhat nondescript visual style and its overwhelming exposition, Halo is bogged down by world-building and almost hampered by its source material."
You,0,"For a thriller that was previously known for dealing largely in shock value, Joe's actions - accompanied once again by his over-indulgent inner monologue - now start to wear thin to the point of becoming predictable."
Peacemaker,0,Despite the near-bottomless charm of star John Cena... Peacemaker is ultimately more of a flimsy throat-clearing than a show with anything to say.
The Shrink Next Door,0,"No expense was spared in building sets and procuring costumes that make the socioeconomic details of this story come through crisply, but both characters are, in the end, ciphers."
The Offer,0,Its goofy failures create a veritable list of guidelines of how not to tell a story when otherwise trying to get across how hard it is to make a movie in Hollywood.
Big Shot,0,"For a show about an ace competitor who finds joy in victory, Big Shot, stacking a canny hero against a universe of people who just don't get it, sure doesn't mind playing unfair."
The Good Wife,0,"The finale was littered with non-conclusions, contradictions and plain old absurdities."
Monsters at Work,0,"As someone who loves the films, I wonder ... do we need more of it? The films are so well self-contained. This feels like an excess of something we don't really need."""
The Pentaverate,0,"Had The Pentaverate been made in 1997, it still might not have been much good, but it would have perhaps made more sense. I’ll give it this, mind – it’s nice."
The X-Files,0,"Based on five episodes made available for preview, things remain uneven -- the first episode is dragged down by more conspiracy blather, interminable voiceover and way too many apocalyptic predictions of doom."
Little Voice,0,The stakes are ludicrously low.
Killing Eve,0,"Weve grown accustomed to queer characters dying on screen, especially ones in relationships. Keeping these women apart for the majority of the series, giving the characters (and fans) what they want, and then ripping it away is such a tired trope."
Jersey Shore,0,"Just because the Jersey Shore era has come to a close, let's not pump it up with either instant nostalgia or importance."
Rome,0,"While the look and feel of the series is still as brilliant as before, it feels wasted on these paltry scripts."
The Beatles: Get Back,0,"There is a point, about five hours in, when the prospect of hearing another ramshackle version of Don't Let Me Down becomes an active threat to the viewer's sanity."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"This Iron Fist ain't immortal, he's got a real short shelf life."
Lost,0,The richest fantasy series I've seen. But its wrap-up sixth season is a drag: This spidery metaphysical puzzle seems to be dwindling down to a hokey primordial myth of good and evil.
The Stand,0,"In 2021, when there's more content out there than any but the shut-in or chronically unemployed can hope to consume, being ignored - as The Stand deserves to be - is perhaps the unkindest fate of all."
The Witcher,0,"The Witcher plods along on its wayward course, piling on complications that, by and large, fail to consistently create the type of urgent stakes-or sense of import."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"[W]hat THE MOSQUITE COAST largely offers is an uninteresting family survival drama, with different villains introduced in each episode strictly for a reason to make the journey more gripping but add nothing meaningful."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"On the whole, the series' inability to decide whether to play things straight or lean into the Ferrell and Rudd reunion makes it hard to get used to anything that's happening."
Waco,0,"The only way the government could look any more like buffoons, barbarians, and jackasses in the series is if the ATF and FBI sequences were soundtracked with ""Yakety Sax."""
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,0,"You can violate the laws of the universe you created, using a raft of new characters in whom we have no investment, or you can drag nine episodes' worth of doing so over 22 hours of TV. Not both."
Invincible,0,"But both the jokes and the character beats that fuel Invincible are too sporadic to make the series feel anything more than sputtering. Unassailable, it is not."
Lovecraft Country,0,"Lovecraft Country feels like a missed opportunity to repurpose the racist fear at the heart of Lovecraft's work to articulate the specific dread, isolation, and social death felt by Black people in all corners of the world."
Bridgerton,0,...it’s difficult to imagine that Bridgerton will ever make quite the splash that the first season did without stars like Page who strike the perfect balance between steamy and silly...
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,Adam McKay’s hodgepodge of postmodern filmmaking deprives the audience of any sense of discovery.
Bridgerton,0,"Bridgerton Season 2 tries hard to please everyone, but ends up feeling watered down."
The Thing About Pam,0,Zellweger is simultaneously broadly cartoonish and blandly nonspecific. She squints so much that her eyes lose whatever interiority they might have reflected; there is no real difference between her smile or her frown.
The Man Who Fell to Earth,0,The Man Who Fell to Earth is like the worst kind of tech bro -- it doesn’t offer anything innovative enough to actually live up to its own hype.
Taboo,0,"Taboo is not so much a show as it is an ordeal, a slog through a miasma of squalid period clichés that's possibly even less inviting than last season's FX vanity production, The Bastard Executioner."
Gaslit,0,Not even Roberts’s blistering portrayal of a woman terrorised into silence is enough to save a drama that is somehow both plodding and overreaching.
Under the Dome,0,"The torturous double-feature of ""Move On"" and ""But I'm Not"" may as well have been in Swahili or Dome-anese because I haven't the foggiest about what actually happened in it. Are we even sure they showed the right episode?"
The Stand,0,"The Stand is a shockingly inept adaptation of Stephen King's most beloved properties. Nearly every creative choice is bad - from bland characters, to stilted dialogue, to glacial pacing. It's just so boring."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"As it nears the end of its run, the series doesn't seem to have much more to say about trauma."
Godless,0,"In Godless, we see a black town, literally called Blackdom, and its inhabitants as ""others..."" Think that's bad? Native American characters do not do better"
Killing Eve,0,"Instead of something small but perfectly formed, Killing Eve has become one of those programmes that seems mainly to inspire the response, “Oh are they still making that?”"
Shadow and Bone,0,"There are shows that flow cohesively and others that feel like several scenes meshed together, and 'Shadow and Bone' has many lost in the mesh."
The Mist,0,"The only times The Mist manages to escape the obvious is in the story of a possible teen sexual assault, which feels slightly more rooted in character and reality but takes a backseat to the show's title malevolent force."
The Baby,0,"It should be weird and captivating! Instead, The Baby meanders..."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"The storylines are byzantine, but they are not complicated. There is also no shortage of weary, heavy-handed platitudes, like fortune cookies that exclusively quote Bob Segar songs."
The Book of Boba Fett,0,This spaceship feels a bit like it's on autopilot.
Black Mirror,0,"Brooker still has the teeth - and the imagination to craft tales that link into our techno-paranoia, showing us a world gone wrong where we are not too careful - but the bite is somewhat lacking."
30 Rock,0,"Anyone returning, hoping for the old Rock rather than the new, is bound to be disappointed in this strained outing."
The Twilight Zone,0,"There's also a lot of potential for season two to reach the same highs that episodes like last season's ""Replay"" delivered. For now, though, season two is off to a mixed start."
Black Mirror,0,"It's weird to feel so poorly about three arguably good episodes of television, but the short length of Season 5 only serves to highlight the deficiencies of the season as a whole."
Snowflake Mountain,0,"In this instance, hate the show, not the contestants, and what we learn is that just when you think Netflix won’t go lower, it certainly will."
The End of the F...ing World,0,Totally disappointing. [Full review in Spanish]
Brave New World,0,"Slick, expensive-looking and with the biggest name behind it, ""Brave"" should have been Peacock's best offering, but instead is its biggest flop."
Riverdale,0,"If the minds behind the show don't seem to care enough about the season 5 cliffhangers to start with them, why should the audience?"
Moon Knight,0,"It ends up feeling both bloated and disposable, something that ultimately has no great purpose to exist other than as another piece of content thrown into the jaws of the Disney+ machine."
The Big Conn,0,"There is no reason this needed to be four one-hour episodes. You can easily edit this down to one two-part and release it that way and the same story gets told. As you are watching it, the viewer is sitting there like, “okay, I get it.”"
WandaVision,0,"The end product is comedically wan, the double-takes broad and all the Olsen/Bettany/Hahn charm squeezed into tiny dabs of screen time"
Stranger Things,0,"What we're left with is a disjointed poorer show. One that's trying to go in various directions, but doesn't always have the room for it, despite the crazy runtimes. I'm afraid Stranger Things 4 has gotten too big for its own good."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,"McKay has entered... an Aaron Sorkin-esque level of directorial obtrusiveness, where a filmmaker’s tics and indulgences keep calling attention to themselves, distracting from the narrative at hand rather than amplifying it."
After Life,0,"Monologues about grief and recovery are painfully trite, painfully single-dimensional; it falls short of even syrupy fare like Ted Lasso."
Stranger Things,0,Season 4 was a 13-hour-plus behemoth that added Wes Craven to its mood board but otherwise ended with undeveloped characters and obvious but superficial allusions to contemporary crises.
The Boondocks,0,"It's a zombie show, like the Dan Harmon-less fourth season of Community. Something's off. You can't figure out exactly what, but you can feel it."
Weeds,0,I'm pretty sure there aren't drugs strong enough to get me to the bittersweet end of this series.
Mare of Easttown,0,"Gone are the days when HBO would produce only outright classics targeted at discerning audiences - in the streaming age, a wider clientele must be catered to."
The Outsider,0,"Like the Stephen King novel it's based upon, The Outsider is an interesting, but not completely satisfying experiment... Even with Erivo and Mendelsohn as sturdy stars, ]it] hasn't quite found a way to give its plunge into the unknown the juice it needs."
The Undoing,0,"While The Undoing strings together just enough surprises to keep viewers interested episode-to-episode, its writing and direction are both muddled, making for an occasionally unpleasant viewing experience."
Shadow and Bone,0,"'Shadow and Bone' is trying to show way too much in too little time, leaving its best intentions emotionally stunted and inert."
Foundation,0,"Foundation isn't based on the books, it's inspired by them. In other words, Foundation merely serves as a - excuse me - foundation for the TV show. I just wish its foundation, the first season, had a better idea of what it wanted to be."
Killing Eve,0,I think most will be disappointed at how far from the first two seasons this series has gone and be thankful that they wont be dragging it out much longer.
Midnight Mass,0,The final scene was so nauseatingly mawkish I had to hide behind the sofa screaming to be put out of my misery.
First Kill,0,"As a cheesy teen soap with supernatural elements, First Kill holds some promise, but that quickly dissipates as the eight-episode season progresses."
The Offer,0,"At 10 hours, the material is stretched absurdly thin, and it makes every flaw show."
Inventing Anna,0,The result falls flat. Inventing Anna is a stretched-out nine-episode romp that never quite catches the enigma of its protagonist -- or matches her appeal.
Pretty Little Liars,0,It's time for Pretty Little Liars to put us out of our misery once and for all. It's an act of mercy that we all deserve.
Prison Break,0,"Once the thrill of becoming reacquainted wears off, you're left with a somewhat muddled, not at all credible yarn."
The White Lotus,0,"Natasha Rothwell's Belinda is the most likable and human character, but her story arc is far too predictable and often gets lost in the dark hijinks..."
They Call Me Magic,0,"Earvin “Magic” Johnson is the cream, the best, on a level above the A list – but when there’s such an overwhelming winner, there’s no sport."
Entourage,0,"""Entourage"" heads into its final eight episodes starting Sunday night and to be honest, it's time."
Chernobyl,0,Mazin name-checks most of the pertinent facts of the story. But his cheap theatrics... detract from the real tragedy of the story.
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"Jessica's 'what makes a hero?' path this season is given plenty of heavy-handed lip service but it feels more like telling than showing, especially as Luke Cage Season 2 handled similar questions much more deftly."
Outer Range,0,"By the end of eight frustrating and haphazardly paced episodes, exhaustion sets in."
And Just Like That...,0,"Ah, well."
Lost,0,"It became a show about placating, even sedating, fans, convincing them that, in the absence of anything coherent or challenging, love was enough."
All American,0,"I expected more from this show - do better, All American."
WandaVision,0,You'll have to wade through a middling '60s sitcom to see what's really going down on Marvel's unconventional WandaVision.
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Despite risible dialogue and a disturbing swing toward cheap theatrics, this weak but watchable legal thriller still puts a human face on the MeToo movement thanks to committed, compelling performances from Sienna Miller and Michelle Dockery."
Mad Men,0,"With each new season, I try to remind myself that the show is a slow burn. The first episode wasn't as glacial as the first episode of last season, but it still dragged a bit."
Chernobyl,0,"We should be engaged by the tragic flaws and nobility of all this by this point, but the story and characters have gone so uncorralled that it takes all your viewing energy just to keep it fractionally straight."
The Wilds,0,"The introduction of the boys is a failed experiment, and unfortunately, apart from a few good moments and an interesting finale, season 2 is a wasted continuation that offers very little."
Fargo,0,"Outsize characterizations are not new for ""Fargo,"" but a balance has been lost here, with many characters standing in for the grandest sorts of evil and too few giving us what the series at its best possesses - soulfulness."
Brave New World,0,"Welcome to this not-so Brave New World, where all the ideas feel old and not nearly as deeply considered as the creators think. But, hey, at least it all looks fabulous."
The Office,0,"There's some symmetry in the fact that after eight years, four Emmys, three regional managers, and an untold number of parties in the conference room, The Office's farewell feels more like an afterthought than an event."
Sex/Life,0,"It loses its rhythm and goes round in circles trying to make a point but it fails terribly. The writing is shallow, the acting sub-par and at most, the racy scenes are endurable."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Kidman has the range to play both the unicorn and the woman, but nobody bothered to give her the more important part of that equation."
Ozark,0,"Yes, I watched the second half of the Netflix hit series’ final season, and no, it wasn’t good. And I say this as someone who used to like the show."
Limitless,0,"There's a story to be told about what it means to be human in a tech-wild, catastrophe-rocked, profoundly uncertain age. Maybe someday, TV will give us that story. Until then, we get generic label pop like Limitless."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,"Winning Time is guaranteed to turn the stomachs of not only Boston Celtics fans, but anyone hoping for more than an egregiously cartoonish and ham-fisted hagiography executed with all the subtlety of a no-look pass."
Night Sky,0,Watch the first episode of Night Sky and you’ll have found your new favourite show. Carry on for another seven and you’ll wish you stopped a lot earlier.
Y: The Last Man,0,"While some intriguing & important new elements are added, like Elliot Fletcher's trans character, the show is so concerned with big ideas it neglects all of its characters."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"A paint-by-numbers thriller that ostensibly investigates the nature of sexual consent without really making us feel invested in any of the characters involved, however well-acted."
Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey,0,Treating this saga mostly as a shocking play-by-play with a reptilian boogeyman at the center feels a little cheap.
True Detective,0,"The new True Detective is faintly pretentious, manageably ridiculous, and dull."
Roar,0,"In the end, the biggest problems with “Roar” may be failures not of the filmmakers, but of the medium itself. Some short stories simply work better on the page"
Foundation,0,"As a new sci-fi show, it would be fine. As a big-budget, flagship production for Apple it looks like a fine opportunity wasted."
Pieces of Her,0,"Despite a gripping and finely acted opening act, this series fails to deliver on the type of artful suspense and nuance it hints at early on."
Looking for Alaska,0,"""Looking For Alaska"" is nostalgic for itself, like it's admiring itself in a mirror instead of making eye contact. This neutralizes the immediacy and intimacy that can make coming-of-age stories so special."
The Nevers,0,The Nevers has a lot going for it but it's a distillation of Whedon's best and worst filmmaking impulses. It needs someone with a more disciplined eye to cut half of its many dangling threads and subplots.
Ramy,0,"Even one great supporting performance, itself overcoming a relatively one-note character, doesn't make the season any less disappointing."
The Office,0,"The Office definitively answers a few key questions about the cogs at the middling paper company Dunder Mifflin - if anyone out there is still interested in the once smart, now just silly sitcom."
Mad Men,0,The season premiere seems as exhausted as the decade it has chronicled so intensely.
WeCrashed,0,"This meaty showcase for Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway is wrapped in a somewhat malnourished limited series, with the misfortune of coming at the tail end of several better productions about high-stakes startups whose founders flew too close to the sun."
Star Wars: Visions,0,"If ""Star Wars: Visions"" does nothing else, it at least tells the story that, if only in part it's an important part, that the long time ago and the galaxy far away was maybe the Tokugawa era in feudal Japan."
House of Cards,0,"It sounds like a compelling story, but Claire remains an icy, tough-to-read cipher through much of it, despite flashbacks to her childhood and that fourth-wall-breaking, talking-to-the-viewers thing that Spacey once did so well."
The White Lotus,0,"Instead of the series' short run delivering a well-honed critique alongside its murder mystery, the end result feels unsatisfyingly unfinished."
13 Reasons Why,0,"Season 4 is a disaster that betrays 13 Reasons Why's characters, its only remaining asset. The show has squandered any goodwill left over by its once-charming cast."
Brave New World,0,"Welcome to this not-so Brave New World, where all the ideas feel old and not nearly as deeply considered as the creators think. But, hey, at least it all looks fabulous."
The Wheel of Time,0,Will The Wheel of Time be a hit? Don't ask me. All I know is that I went into a kind of death spiral after watching the first episode.
The Boondocks,0,"It's a zombie show, like the Dan Harmon-less fourth season of Community. Something's off. You can't figure out exactly what, but you can feel it."
Stranger Things,0,"For every fun and exciting element introduced, there is an overwhelming mushy gray pile of slog to wade through."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"Ultimately, the first season feels a bit like a walkway to the real story -- or, more accurately, a runway. It's a lot of busy preamble."
Love Life,0,"No matter how much you can appreciate the character's journey, it's not easy for any actor to carry this type of story, but Harper would make you believe otherwise. Here's hoping he gets even better material moving forward."
The First Lady,0,"The Showtime miniseries, starring Viola Davis, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Gillian Anderson, manages to make life as a White House wife seem both cosmic and forgettable."
Sex/Life,0,"For a show about the basic instincts, it's unusually removed from anything recognizably human; for a look at what it means to heedlessly seek fulfillment, it's surprisingly sour and mean."
Lovecraft Country,0,"A by-the-numbers story that wants to be bold and daring, and in so doing ends up not engaging with its own strongest elements."
Safe,0,It's a thriller by numbers that doesn't feel clever enough for its talented cast.
The Mist,0,"The only times The Mist manages to escape the obvious is in the story of a possible teen sexual assault, which feels slightly more rooted in character and reality but takes a backseat to the show's title malevolent force."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"The best part about 9 Perfect Strangers is that the Wikipedia entry states up top ""not to be confused with Perfect Strangers."" Oh, how I wish that this were the tale of 9 Balkis..."
Foundation,0,"Not much about Foundation sticks, either emotionally or narratively. There are cause-and-effect relationships between one event and another, but they're stretched across long-attenuated frames."
Twin Peaks,0,"It's hard not to feel like I've been completely, utterly duped. The two-hour kickoff did not repair the damage wrought by Season 2. If anything, it was like taking a sip of damn fine coffee after learning that someone had stuck a fish in the pot."
Brave New World,0,"For the most part, we're left with an unsexy portrait of decadence, a thriller without thrills, a prescription that's less soma than Sominex."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"This Iron Fist ain't immortal, he's got a real short shelf life."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Maybe it'll tie together in the final two episodes and reach a dramatically satisfying conclusion with a few nifty turns and twists down the stretch. So far, though, this is a perfectly mediocre affair."
Schmigadoon!,0,"Strong appears genuinely entertained and can hold a lovely note alongside the rest of the stage-ready cast. Still, neither the writing nor direction take advantage of the skills that Strong has honed throughout her time on Saturday Night Live."
The Endgame,0,"The Endgame is by turns boring and by other turns generic and nonsensical. Its story isn’t compelling enough to follow beyond the first episode, and we’re figuring that the interplay between its stars isn’t enough to keep people watching."
Foundation,0,"Spanning a millennium and juggling at least half-a-dozen narratives at any given moment, Foundation is suitably epic to behold, but has the emotional intensity of a lecture on particle physics."
Our Flag Means Death,0,Our Flag Means Death proves to be too droll for its own good.
Two and a Half Men,0,"I swear to God, I don't think I could come up with a worse ending."
The Staircase,0,"I strongly considered sticking a fork in my eye at least eight times while the footage rolled... and rolled, and rolled, and rolled."
Marvel's Hero Project,0,"The real-world stories are inspiring enough. The framing device, in which the word ""Marvel"" is pronounced as often as is (slightly more than) seemly, is a distraction that feels like self-promotion."
The Beatles: Get Back,0,"As a document of the breakdown of the Beatles, Get Back seems to exist for posterity rather than enjoyment."
The Outsider,0,"Curiously -- and annoyingly -- uneven, as if different production crews took over on alternate days undoing one another's work."
The Book of Boba Fett,0,The Book of Boba Fett is beyond even an experiment. It should be a bellwether for future writers and producers – because it takes us all for granted.
Lost,0,The series squandered its final season in a misguided effort to transform its trademark narrative ingenuity into a grand metaphysical statement.
Fargo,0,"Fargo has always been a little off-kilter, but those elements stand out as particularly indulgent or egregious this season, when its overall storytelling approach is so uneven."
Inventing Anna,0,"It’s a Sisyphean task to get us to care as much about the writing of an article as the escapades of the person being written about, and neither the series nor a surprisingly depthless Chlumsky succeeds in doing so."
And Just Like That...,0,"And Just Like That... is a massive departure from Sex and the City in all the worst ways. It trades in its wit for a humorless, tone-deaf sequel series that struggles to make any case for its existence."
They Call Me Magic,0,"Earvin “Magic” Johnson is the cream, the best, on a level above the A list – but when there’s such an overwhelming winner, there’s no sport."
The Outsider,0,"Like the Stephen King novel it's based upon, The Outsider is an interesting, but not completely satisfying experiment... Even with Erivo and Mendelsohn as sturdy stars, ]it] hasn't quite found a way to give its plunge into the unknown the juice it needs."
Rise,0,"Rise wants to be an inspiring drama. More accurate to describe it as a drama about wanting to be inspirational...Rise seems uninterested in its own best instincts, willing to bring up ideas but unwilling to carry them over the finish line."
Bridgerton,0,"Season 1 may have left audiences hot under the collar and begging for more the first time around, unfortunately its successor is more likely to leave viewers yawning, such is the state of affairs with season two."
Peacemaker,0,"""Peacemaker"" exposes a bigger problem: in a minor role with an ensemble of zany characters, Cena's witty banter felt like a breath of fresh air. In a eight-hour episodic series with lackluster supporting players, Cena struggles to carry the load."
Amazing Stories,0,"The show seems to be an intentional throwback, trading on Spielberg nostalgia to draw those who recognize the original, or just its family-friendly appeal, into Apple's orbit -- but it comes off more dated than deliberately retro."
Arrested Development,0,"What's missing here, to a depressing degree, is a sense of purpose."
Pieces of Her,0,"If, like me, you want something deeper, you’ll find Pieces of Her’s biggest mystery will be how this tonally mismatched, structurally messy show came to be."
Hawkeye,0,"For a series about a pair of sharpshooters, Hawkeye frustratingly misses the mark too often. Well, at least for viewers who aren't its target audience."
Bel-Air,0,It’s probably the most 2022 thing imaginable to take one adored show and reboot it in a way that feels derivative of at least a half-dozen other shows.
Russian Doll,0,"It is an ambitious but ultimately lacking attempt at illustrating how trauma is inherited from one generation to the next, at the expense of the protagonists’ development and season one friendship."
Bodyguard,0,"Unfortunately, full of filler where there should be thriller, Bodyguard just can't get the job done, literally or figuratively."
The Outsider,0,"The stakes here seem to be massive; gradually, it becomes clear that an epidemic of darkness is overtaking many. But getting there, with so little in the way of character or freshness of tone, simply exhausts even an interested viewer."
The Mist,0,"Some character depth would help maintain interest for 10 episodes around a scary fog, but from the town's cops to the high school jocks, it all feels like a mediocre horror movie. That's a hard sell for 10 weeks."
Battlestar Galactica,0,I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE YELLED AT A SHOW LIKE THIS. I WAS ROOTING FOR YOU. WE WERE ALL ROOTING FOR YOU! HOW DARE YOU!
The Flight Attendant,0,"I never understood the appeal of The Flight Attendant, and I still don't."
Loot,0,The greatest crime of Loot is how much it fails its leading lady.
Taboo,0,"Not even often-stunning performances... can dig Taboo out of its messy, overwrought darkness."
Altered Carbon,0,"It had good moments, it had bad moments, it had dull moments. I kind of wish now that there was just Season 1 standing alone as a great example of the genre..."
Altered Carbon,0,"I found myself desperately wishing for Altered Carbon to leave its world of endless lives, satellite back ups, and shapeless political revolutions behind, to focus... on the AIs discarded by humanity as yet another resource to be wasted and forgotten."
Big Little Lies,0,Season two's biggest shortcoming is the way it prioritized Mary-Louise at the expense of Bonnie.
Loki,0,"The series achieves its ultimate manifestation as Saturday-afternoon animation. With Loki, Marvel, Disney, and their die-hard constituents have found ways to make the banal even more banal."
The Undoing,0,"The Undoing is gratingly off-key. It invites us to sympathise with poor, rich Grace as her bubble of privilege bursts. Not right now, thanks."
Midnight Mass,0,"Midnight Mass only really gets going in episode three. And, when it finally sets off, it doesn't seem to know where it is heading."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"The bottom line is Apple has produced a series that not only fails to get under your skin, but mostly just makes you want to swat it away."
Devs,0,A product that delivers neither the wildly creative sense of tech's possibilities nor the ground-level excavation of his characters... Devs is a misfire for a talented creator.
Schmigadoon!,0,"There's too much talent here for Schmigadoon! to ever be a total waste, but the show is far more pandering than nurturing."
Ozark,0,I was annoyed and rolling my eyes. I was on the edge of my seat wondering if the show would do anything truly surprising.
Vigil,0,"According to the end credits, Vigil has been made with support from the Scottish government, which makes no secret of its opposition to nuclear weapons. That may hint at an extra political edge, but doesn't make this a compelling drama."
Twin Peaks,0,"The original run is one of TV's masterpieces, and Lynch finally returning to this project -- and unshackled by network restrictions -- was great news. In retrospect, limitations might have been welcome since this suffers from extreme excess and overkill."
The Mosquito Coast,0,Even [Justin Theroux's] absorbing performance can't make Mosquito Coast make sense.
Mayor of Kingstown,0,A disappointing bleak drama that doesn't have anything new to say.
Invasion,0,"For all that money, we might have expected more. The plotting is occasionally a letdown too, bordering on infuriating."
Mad Men,0,"There are peaks and valleys, but mostly there's a lot of flat, ugly middle. The victories that you spend forever building end up being as ephemeral as fireworks, sparkling briefly before quickly fading back into the endless blackness of the nighttime sky."
Lovecraft Country,0,"There's something mechanical about Lovecraft Country's horror, both real and supernatural."
13 Reasons Why,0,"The show's myopia isn't surprising. If anything, the final season proves once again that teen viewers deserved better than what 13 Reasons Why offered, and if the show is remembered in a few years, it'll be mostly for what it failed to do."
Severance,0,"If the series wants to tackle the exploitation of labor, even in its own exaggerated way, it usually helps when the authoritarians' methods of oppression make sense—logically and emotionally..."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"In Anatomy of a Scandal, there is the matter of what constitutes consent and what is rape. But the muddled storytelling leaves the victim behind."
Behind Her Eyes,0,"The empty characterization isn't egregious, but it seems like an apparatus that's been built around some hidden central engine the show doesn't want to reveal. Why are these people like this?"
After Life,0,It's a season that betrays its own legacy and destroys the absolute brilliance of the first season.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,0,"You can violate the laws of the universe you created, using a raft of new characters in whom we have no investment, or you can drag nine episodes' worth of doing so over 22 hours of TV. Not both."
Amazing Stories,0,"Optimism isn't a bad thing to have on TV shows, but when that's the only thing you've got going for you, living up to ""amazing"" seems like a reach."
The First Lady,0,"While it celebrates women who break the mold, the show itself is deeply — and dispiritingly — conventional."
A Teacher,0,Lots of people have bad childhoods and boring spouses yet never end up becoming sexual predators. Where's the limited series about those people?
Ozark,0,The final episodes were just awful. Everything that kept me from really bonding with the series about a family breaking bad was on display in those last hours.
Chucky,0,There's only one vaguely interesting formula tweak here and it's Mancini's decision to make his protagonist queer and then to handle it with a refreshingly casual sensitivity.
Six Feet Under,0,"Now I've had it with people who insist on making themselves miserable, as if it were an art."
The Undoing,0,"While The Undoing strings together just enough surprises to keep viewers interested episode-to-episode, its writing and direction are both muddled, making for an occasionally unpleasant viewing experience."
Hawkeye,0,"""Hawkeye"" is too beholden to the larger MCU as a guiding narrative force and generic house style of filming to truly find its own voice..."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Elena is thinly drawn as an obviously villainous ""white savior"" and Witherspoon is repeating her performance from Big Little Lies with less nuance and shading."
The Beatles: Get Back,0,The Beatles: Get Back documentary proves once again that Peter Jackson's meticulous approach to filmmaking is impressive but excessive.
Black Mirror,0,The fifth season of Black Mirror isn't necessary bad -- each episode has a glimmer of something exciting -- but unfortunately that didn't quite go far enough.
Lisey's Story,0,"The back half of this miniseries is so bogged down by inconsistent pacing, drawn-out scenes, muddled plotting, and a frustratingly anticlimactic ending that all the good Lisey's Story delivers before that collapse ends up overshadowed."
The Baby,0,"It’s all pretty perfunctory and over-reliant on one single, repetitive plot point that ends up not being scary, sinister, or engaging enough to compel you to see what comes next."
The Stand,0,"Stripping this story of pretty much every shred of dramatic weight and emotional engagement is no easy task, but CBS has accomplished it"
The Wheel of Time,0,"As much as The Wheel of Time left me indifferent, I very much warmed to the universe of the Aes Sedais. Your introduction to them is Moiraine, and it's difficult not to be intrigued by her order. She's the type of woman who doesn't hear ""no"" often."
Dr. Brain,0,"For a show with a wild central premise and a goofily brazen title, nothing here rises to the level of wildness that the show is teasing, nor is there the sort of grounding that could work as an alternative."
The Nevers,0,"This potentially provocative, supernatural sci-fi series is unfocused and uneven."
Brave New World,0,"Despite some evocative (and provocative) visuals and appropriate dramatic tension, it fails to truly excite."
The Undoing,0,"It's almost hard to believe that stars Nicole Kidman and Hugh Grant, series writer David E. Kelley and series director Susanne Bier could come up with a show so limp, so generic, so dispiritingly bad as this six-hour drama."
The Night Of,0,"This drawn-out, plodding miniseries stretches every one of its meager strengths beyond its breaking point."
Entourage,0,"""Entourage"" heads into its final eight episodes starting Sunday night and to be honest, it's time."
Prison Break,0,"There's a reason the phrase ""You can't go home again"" amounts to a cliché. You really can't. Especially when home is a prison."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"""Mayor of Kingstown"" appears tailor-made to be forever confused with 100 other shows like it, shackled and forgotten in its allegiance to an outdated template."
House of Cards,0,"House of Cards never quite maintains momentum, again; the first five episodes sent to critics are sometimes promising, sometimes plodding."
Halo,0,"Between the series’s somewhat nondescript visual style and its overwhelming exposition, Halo is bogged down by world-building and almost hampered by its source material."
Servant,0,"Those who've been just as mystified, expecting a third season to answer the many questions it's raised, or at least a deeper dive following the supernatural events of the Season One cliffhanger, will be terribly disappointed."
The Affair,0,The Affair Season 5 Episode 1 was a colossal waste of time.
The Expanse,0,"The season feels incomplete, an insufficient and far too economical kiss off for such an intricately constructed show. It's sad to see a world built with the breadth of the universe have no room to breathe."
Amazing Stories,0,"With only 52 minutes of running time, The Cellar feels like a TV movie condensed to the length of a TV episode. Its characters are painted in wide brush strokes."
Stranger Things,0,"This is the very definition of “treading water TV”, despite its big-budget fanciness, Stranger Things is really no different from any generic network procedural."
Invasion,0,Invasion proceeds so incrementally across such a wide range of characters and their responses to extraterrestrial terrorism that you might well lose your way from week to week. Never mind your interest.
A Wilderness of Error,0,Morris' book meticulously chronicled a wilderness of errors. All Smerling's documentary does is get lost in a wilderness of voices.
Stranger Things,0,"This is the very definition of “treading water TV”, despite its big-budget fanciness, Stranger Things is really no different from any generic network procedural."
11.22.63,0,Feels like something ABC might have aired in 1997.
The Beatles: Get Back,0,"The Beatles: Get Back only truly comes to life when the eponymous band performs, and it happens far less than you might want over the course of 8 hours."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"Thinking ruins it in a very specific ways. Kick the mental tires too much on this genre romance, and the whole thing slides right into Skeeveyville."
The Offer,0,"Unfortunately, the resulting product is frequently too on-the-nose. If there’s any reason to watch, it’s for the performance of actor Matthew Goode as legendary Paramount executive Robert Evans."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"Unless Alice and her rabbit pal have more tricks up their sleeve than Snow White and the gang could muster, ABC's visit to Wonderland might once again leave the network less in need of a looking glass than a rear-view mirror."
Black Mirror,0,The fifth season of Black Mirror isn't necessary bad -- each episode has a glimmer of something exciting -- but unfortunately that didn't quite go far enough.
Big Little Lies,0,"The series works best when it focuses on intimate, human moments rather than on broad social critiques."
Amazing Stories,0,"Maybe the show will get better; I hope it does. But with so many shows on so many different platforms right now, it seems like Amazing Stories blew its one chance to make a good first impression."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"With the mothership's leads on a similar quest for a missing boy, Wonderland seems like an exercise in magical redundancy. This looking glass is cracked."
The Pentaverate,0,"Although its fantastic to have Mike Myers back in action, the series is underwhelming in elaborating its premise and comedy. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Shrink Next Door,0,Mainly what held my interest in The Shrink Next Door was the myriad reasons it doesn't quite work.
Players,0,Players fell short of the mark for me.
The Stand,0,"It's curiously bland, devoid of most of the scares that King is known for, and telling a straightforward story in a faithful but lifeless manner."
The OA,0,"Events, characters and half-formed ideas are thrown at the screen then abandoned in favour of fresh mysteries, the show infinitely rolling out a carpet of kookiness."
The Wilds,0,"The end result is a season that is overstuffed and yet drags, as though the boys sucked all the energy out of the first season, as they do."
Brave New World,0,"It's just never compelling, never engrossing and, worst of all, not thought-provoking to the degree it needs to be given its subject matter and acclaimed, if dated, source material."
The Stand,0,"Stripping this story of pretty much every shred of dramatic weight and emotional engagement is no easy task, but CBS has accomplished it"
Jericho,0,"On paper, the idea of building a new democracy from the ruins of war while government contractors run amok is just as strong as the original premise of Jericho. But the execution remains mediocre."
Six Feet Under,0,"Now I've had it with people who insist on making themselves miserable, as if it were an art."
Treadstone,0,"While lots of action films require the audience to suspend disbelief at times, Treadstone requires them to saw the tops of their own heads off and remove the gooey blob inside. It's the only way you'll survive the writing."
The Thing About Pam,0,There’s a lot of blurriness of intention around the storytelling in The Thing About Pam and an ultimately complacent belief that Renée Zellweger slurping on soda is enough to count as Emmy bait.
Night Sky,0,"Night Sky begins as a beautiful coming-of-old-age story, but it splinters into an overstuffed sci-fi thriller."
House of Cards,0,"House of Cards never quite maintains momentum, again; the first five episodes sent to critics are sometimes promising, sometimes plodding."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"A dour, flavorless combination of familiar crime-drama elements, led by Renner at his most glum."
The Thing About Pam,0,"A watchable if often underwhelming true crime docudrama that wants to both be weird and play it safe, ending up in a strange middle ground between the two."
The Queen's Gambit,0,"It is a show that takes itself so seriously that, when former child actor Thomas Brodie-Sangster turns up dressed like an escapee from the Wild West, you don't know whether it's meant to be funny or not"
Inside Amy Schumer,0,"There are jokes about what it means to be an everyday woman, but they're sprinkled in among jokes about what it must be like to be Amy Schumer, and it messes with the voice of the show."
The Twilight Zone,0,"One of the major issues of Peele's debut season was the runtime for episodes. This season is no exception, and of the three episodes screened, only one truly earns the extra half-hour - and even then, it could easily be chiseled down."
The Big Bang Theory,0,"I'm not sure if they got the physics exactly right, but The Big Bang Theory somehow ended not with a breakup but an ""I love you."""
Schmigadoon!,0,"There's too much talent here for Schmigadoon! to ever be a total waste, but the show is far more pandering than nurturing."
Arrested Development,0,"You could forgive all this if these episodes were funny, if they contained even a trace of the spark that made its first run so incredible. But they aren't. They're flat and lifeless and pointless."
Lost,0,The feel-good moments at the end don't make up for six seasons of stringing viewers along without ever providing any real answers or any real closure.
The First Lady,0,"Ten episodes in, you don’t come away feeling you know the stories of these women any better, any deeper, than you already did."
Altered Carbon,0,"I found myself desperately wishing for Altered Carbon to leave its world of endless lives, satellite back ups, and shapeless political revolutions behind, to focus... on the AIs discarded by humanity as yet another resource to be wasted and forgotten."
Behind Her Eyes,0,"The empty characterization isn't egregious, but it seems like an apparatus that's been built around some hidden central engine the show doesn't want to reveal. Why are these people like this?"
Schmigadoon!,0,"There's too much talent here for Schmigadoon! to ever be a total waste, but the show is far more pandering than nurturing."
The Morning Show,0,"You've got to appreciate the moxie of a high-profile streaming series where a character blurts, ""Another streaming service? It should be illegal."" That's The Morning Show's second season in a nutshell: having its cake while choking on it."
Hawkeye,0,Hawkeye feels like it will end up being a quick wiki article scan to get caught up on where everything stands instead of its own standalone story.
The Sopranos,0,"To me, it felt like an hourlong f--- you from a guy who has seen fan devotion for The Sopranos transform him from a little-known but well respected TV producer into one of the most legendary TV auteurs in history."
Pieces of Her,0,"A tedious, tiresome mess that almost put me to sleep."
Slow Horses,0,This spy thriller hitches its wagon to an insufferable performance.
Joe vs Carole,0,"It's called Joe vs. Carole, but it should have been called Dumb vs Dumber."
House of Cards,0,"In the moments when Claire is allowed not just the camera but the story, ""House of Cards"" is a ride; when the past is relitigated and the specter of Frank rears up once more, it feels like that worst thing a binge-able drama can be: a trudge."
All of Us Are Dead,0,It's delivered in an oddly-paced season that fights against an intuitive structure as much as these students try to beat back chomps from throngs of kids in uniforms.
Star Trek,0,"It's just an unlikely space opera, overlong, clunkily put together and not the slightest bit amusing."
The Office,0,"There's some symmetry in the fact that after eight years, four Emmys, three regional managers, and an untold number of parties in the conference room, The Office's farewell feels more like an afterthought than an event."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Out of all the thriller fare that Kelley has adapted for the small screen to date, the whole of Anatomy of a Scandal is disappointingly much less compelling than the sum of its parts."
Joe vs Carole,0,"In practice, Joe vs. Carole feels like a brutally over-extended Saturday Night Live sketch, leaning heavily on the jokes we know and expect while clumsily trying to tease out some deeper meaning."
The Undoing,0,"The issue isn't that The Undoing tries to channel Big Little Lies, but that it does so unsuccessfully. Even in its failures, however, The Undoing made me dream of a world where TV could crack the code..."
The X-Files,0,"I honestly can't tell whether or not Mulder's dialogue is supposed to sound ridiculous (in the second episode he utters this baffling phrase: ""Scully, you looked so adorbs"")."
Taboo,0,"With listless pacing and no characters to care about... Taboo, you win. You're the best at being the worst."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,It's much better paced and way easier to watch. But coming back from what was a truly lack-luster first season... was going to take a complete overhaul of the series and it's hard to say if that was ever going to be possible.
Stranger Things,0,Stranger Things is still Stranger Things. It just now comes with astoundingly thick levels of padding.
Little Fires Everywhere,0,...the series is driven by a muddle-headed and confused notion about what's wrong with the U.S...
The Witcher,0,"In its attempt to build a bigger world, the series falls prey to more fantasy tropes than it masters."
True Blood,0,Although the series could have continued - maybe by introducing zombies or mummies - True Blood had nowhere to go but in circles. It was time to put a stake in it.
Brave New World,0,"For the most part, we're left with an unsexy portrait of decadence, a thriller without thrills, a prescription that's less soma than Sominex."
Boardwalk Empire,0,"So many great actors, so little for most of them to do. Good acting can get you through times of confused and misguided writing, but can only take a show so far."
Y: The Last Man,0,"Considering just how beloved Y: The Last Man is and its long development period, it's disappointing that the show's opening episodes aren't better."
The Stand,0,"Boone and Cavell make a series of choices that not only diminish the awesome terror of the first part of King's novel, but the characters themselves, their journeys, and any reason we should care about them."
A Wilderness of Error,0,"A Wilderness of Error is a fascinating and informative look at a notorious piece of American history, but it struggles to defend its own relevance."
Bridgerton,0,"The first episode in the new season lasts eight hours and 24 minutes. No, not really. It does feel interminable, though."
Halo,0,"The goal shouldn’t be about being everything to everyone, and while “Halo” treats the source material with respect, it does so with a tentativeness, as if it is afraid to miss a key element."
WeCrashed,0,"This meaty showcase for Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway is wrapped in a somewhat malnourished limited series, with the misfortune of coming at the tail end of several better productions about high-stakes startups whose founders flew too close to the sun."
Amazing Stories,0,"This show should have been a home run. In my opinion the missed opportunity lies in three areas: the story, the pacing and the direction."
The Wheel of Time,0,"It does eventually bed in somewhat, but not as much as it should."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,0,"The split timeline is a plague on TV, and its latest victim is Showtime’s The Man Who Fell to Earth."
Ozark,0,The final episodes were just awful. Everything that kept me from really bonding with the series about a family breaking bad was on display in those last hours.
The Staircase,0,"To call The Staircase a docu-series is a gross exaggeration. It is filmed entirely from the perspective of Peterson's team, an overwrought exploration of a self-involved family."
Bel-Air,0,"Bel-Air is a glossy, expensive-looking soap that, like Fox’s Our Kind of People, puts the spotlight on uber-wealthy Black families. But “fresh?” Not so much."
What If...?,0,"For a series set in the infinite vastness of a multiverse, What If...? is dreaming awfully small."
Fringe,0,"At some point, Fringe kind of fell in love with change for its own sake, and it wandered away for long periods from what powered its finest moments - the complex bonds among Olivia, Peter and Walter."
The Stand,0,"This new version has its inspired moments, like the way Billy Joel's ""The Stranger"" somehow turns out to be the perfect theme song for Flagg, but the structure keeps sucking the life out of things, from major characters to more minor ones."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,0,"What audiences get is a family melodrama where mental illness is addressed on the way to another destination. There’s no doubting the sincerity of those involved, but ultimately this glossy slice of streaming content lacks teeth in its latter stages..."
The Essex Serpent,0,"A decent production budget and starry cast led by Tom Hiddleston and Claire Danes are squandered on a dreary, convoluted, portentous drama with all the appeal of a fog blanket over a giant rotting fish which someone briefly mistook for a dead dragon."
Limitless,0,"Yet while Limitless is competently executed, what it lacks, finally, is any spark of inspiration. And alas, there's no pill for that."
Sex/Life,0,The eight-episode season easily could’ve been boiled down into two TikToks...
Hawkeye,0,"Even a show that approaches its episodic run like an extra-long movie owes the audience a bit more momentum than this, especially when those installments roll out weekly."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,A story that lacks strength... torn between what it wants to tell and how. [Full review in Spanish]
The Mist,0,"The only times The Mist manages to escape the obvious is in the story of a possible teen sexual assault, which feels slightly more rooted in character and reality but takes a backseat to the show's title malevolent force."
The First,0,"It's too much buildup for too little payoff. By the time the series is ready to launch, we're already charting a course for somewhere else."
The Undoing,0,"While beautiful to look at, the show struggles to say something compelling as it's more interested in amplifying the melodrama instead of delving deep into its more interesting subjects."
Inventing Anna,0,"In trying to make the show about gossip and the media, Inventing Anna actually misses whatever it is that Anna herself was up to and rather focused on what she thought she was doing. Instead of adding complexity, it just comes off as muddled."
All of Us Are Dead,0,"While the diminishing returns of the shows narrative are a disappointment, the moral implications of its wide-ranging smorgasbord of social commentary are bewildering, if not outright alarming."
Lisey's Story,0,This show is hellbent on driving me mad thanks to one of its biggest stumbling blocks: the absence of any sort of logic to this universe.
Devs,0,"Garland's vision is in the forefront here, and the result is a limited series with a frosty emotional tone, and a story heavy on cutting-edge techno-speak, but skimpy when it comes to characterization."
Arrested Development,0,No programme is more infuriatingly chuffed with itself.
Taboo,0,"Not even often-stunning performances... can dig Taboo out of its messy, overwrought darkness."
Landscapers,0,"Every bit of this story is as weird as hell. The trouble is that, on screen, weirdness itself doesn't really give you very far to go."
True Detective,0,"A thin story spread over a lot of hours, but Ali is excellent and so is his support."
The Umbrella Academy,0,"This is the most apocalyptic-y apocalypse ever, but it carries no real weight. Then when you find out what has to be done to save the universe, it just feels very underwhelming. Samurais, really?"
WandaVision,0,"The end product is comedically wan, the double-takes broad and all the Olsen/Bettany/Hahn charm squeezed into tiny dabs of screen time"
Black Mirror,0,"In the best and worst exploitation tradition, ""Striking Vipers"" warns you not to treat others as a game. Then it goes ahead and does exactly that."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Little fires will quickly merge into an overwhelming flame, and even though this is the first scene of the series, Hulu's adaptation goes right ahead and burns itself out."
Lost,0,The feel-good moments at the end don't make up for six seasons of stringing viewers along without ever providing any real answers or any real closure.
Invasion,0,"Invasion is a ten-hour season devoid of nearly all humor, where characters across the globe continually bumble around in their own misery, resentful that aliens keep interrupting their tragic lives."
The Bletchley Circle,0,"Still fun on its own terms, the encore takes an unexpected little gem and transforms it into Murder, She (and She and She and She) Wrote."
Naomi,0,"On both the teen and super aspects, this series misses the mark."
Halo,0,The frustrating thing about Halo is that it tries to serve two masters -- diehard Halo fans and newbies who are used to the normal rhythms of sci-fi streaming series -- and doesn’t quite please either.
The Undoing,0,"It's all extremely rote, like an expanded version of the mid-budget Nineties movie that would have starred Kidman and Grant at their respective heights of celebrity."
The Offer,0,"This Seventies flashback tries to hit a lot of marks at once... The only way it genuinely works, however, is as a parody of prestige TV."
Boardwalk Empire,0,"These great clunking scenes are not only dull and unnecessary, they also draw unwanted attention to Boardwalk's greatest weakness. Empathy can't be retconned. It has to be earned."
Bridgerton,0,Season 2 timidly skimmed the surface of such representation when I needed it to leap into sumptuous storytelling. I couldn’t escape into it while I was also trying to navigate its unsatisfying approach to inclusivity.
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"This update brings the star power of Jessica Chastain and Oscar Isaac, but can't match the emotional intensity of the original."
Mad Men,0,"There are peaks and valleys, but mostly there's a lot of flat, ugly middle. The victories that you spend forever building end up being as ephemeral as fireworks, sparkling briefly before quickly fading back into the endless blackness of the nighttime sky."
The Staircase,0,"To call The Staircase a docu-series is a gross exaggeration. It is filmed entirely from the perspective of Peterson's team, an overwrought exploration of a self-involved family."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Hulu trotted out Little Fires Everywhere, an eight-part limited series that attempts to capture the sprawling nature of the source material, but ultimately fails."
Night Sky,0,"After that first hour, you may be holding back tears. But after seven more, your eyes have glazed over, and even these luminous stars can’t bring you back to Earth."
Rise,0,"... Rise feels like a rehash, a collection of stories we've already seen, presented with a slightly darker palette."
Inventing Anna,0,"Inventing Anna transforms a juicy real-life drama about a con artist among the influencer crowd into a fairly inert limited series, in part by giving almost equal weight to the reporter who broke the story."
Lisey's Story,0,"Lisey's Story is, on all fronts, too much. Too long, too over-produced, too many talents, too overwrought, too much going on."
The Endgame,0,"Morena Baccarin and Ryan Michelle Bathe, longtime supporting players getting starring roles in a large-scale series for the first time, do not feel irreplaceable, and the show's clunky, obvious writing doesn't give them much to work with."
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"You end up wondering whether they are true soulmates, or just trauma-bonded beyond redemption. Christ, you think, move on, but, alas, they won't."
Snowflake Mountain,0,A bunch of supposed adults complaining about having to take a dump in a latrine.
Ozark,0,"The tension all goes slack, formerly compelling characters end up being waved at each other like wooden dolls, and yet another prestige drama leaves the audience wondering why they bothered."
Raised by Wolves,0,Raised by Wolves wafts into emotional and narrative oblivion.
Lovecraft Country,0,"Lovecraft Country feels like a missed opportunity to repurpose the racist fear at the heart of Lovecraft's work to articulate the specific dread, isolation, and social death felt by Black people in all corners of the world."
The Night Of,0,A show like this one is so busy saying something about the justice system and the prison-industrial complex that it rarely has a moment to consider that one of the injustices here is that a person was killed.
Mayor of Kingstown,0,It is a bleak drama series that doesn't seem to bring anything new to the table
11.22.63,0,"If Stephen King could go back in time, maybe he'd decide to stop selling his books to television."
The Wheel of Time,0,"The Wheel Of Time is definitely a talky mess of a show, at least to start. It throws a lot of characters at us, but somehow all the time taken to establish them doesn't give us any more idea about them than when the episode started."
The Office,0,"It succumbed to the bane of American TV -- the endless more-more-more of anything good or popular, the twisting of characters into pretzels to simply keep them in motion, the cheap substitutes after lead actors depart."
Bodyguard,0,"After a few chapters, Bodyguard does something that is as bold as it is absurd, changing all the pieces of the game, but losing all cohesion. [Full review in Spanish]"
And Just Like That...,0,"If the iconic image of ""Sex and the City"" is its central quartet striding down a Manhattan sidewalk, this is a series on its back heels: defensive, reactive, terrified to offend."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,The true scandal is how lazy it all feels.
Sex and the City,0,"I got to wondering: didn't we reach a climax in our relationship with Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda sooner than any of us would dare to admit?"
The Nevers,0,"There are too many characters, too many high-stakes plotlines, and not enough explanation for how it all connects."
Line of Duty,0,It all feels very much as if Line Of Duty is running out of energy and impetus. Six seasons is one too many.
Battlestar Galactica,0,A lot of basic and mundane things don't add up for me.
Marvel's The Punisher,0,Why are we coming back to all these people again?
What If...?,0,"The light fun of it is eaten away by the cynicism from within the project, that what purports to be about infinite possibilities is blatantly more about repurposing."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"Remembering Peter Weir's 1986 film, a descent-into-madness tragedy set entirely on the titular coast of Honduras, could be more of a hindrance to enjoying this new take."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"The dull courtroom sequences occasionally slip into stagey reconstructions of what happened between defendant and accused. At no point does Kelley’s series pause to consider what it is it’s trying to say about, um, well, anything."
How I Met Your Mother,0,This finale seems to completely sour the show's legacy - something that is not more important than ever.
Loki,0,It's nevertheless a bit of a letdown when you realize halfway through the dense first episode that one of the MCU's ostensibly most unpredictable lead characters has somehow landed in the most predictable of setups.
Bridgerton,0,"The first episode in the new season lasts eight hours and 24 minutes. No, not really. It does feel interminable, though."
Glee,0,"While the new kids at McKinley get a few quirky gags, they feel half-hearted, as if only real remaining mission is to follow our old friends to the finish line. That's fine. But we could have done it two seasons ago and not missed much."
Parenthood,0,"The writers' decision to go full cheeseball ending shouldn't have been surprising, after the show spent its last year turning into a frustrating shadow of itself."
Arrested Development,0,"Unfortunately for the show, even without the controversies putting a cloud over proceedings, the simple fact of the matter is that this season just isn't that good."
A Very English Scandal,0,"""A Very English Scandal"" plays too much with tragedy."
Scandal,0,"Looking back, the real Scandal was that anyone kept watching."
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,0,"The show feels like more Star Wars: Clone Wars, and yet never reaches the heights that it's sister series did, and ultimately doesn't find it's own voice as a result."
Preacher,0,"Preacher Season 4 starts strong, but it can't escape the snare of mediocrity, no matter how much craziness it throws our way. And while the show is rarely subjectively bad, it continues to have issues with tone and characterizations."
True Blood,0,Headaches will be induced just in trying to unravel the plot mess Bon Temps finds itself in. At least this will be the last headache.
The Mysterious Benedict Society,0,"There is potential in here, though, especially through the committed performances from the cast. But right now The Mysterious Benedict Society needs more mysteries and fewer answers."
Man vs. Bee,0,"After a certain point, you stop questioning things and instead enter a fugue state. Is time passing, or are you just stuck in some horrendous ten-minute long Groundhog Day?"
Snowflake Mountain,0,A bunch of supposed adults complaining about having to take a dump in a latrine.
Moon Knight,0,"Flashes of brilliance offer a glimpse of the more introspective, imaginative show we were promised, and the finale has the opportunity to deliver. As it stands, though, Marvel Studios' latest Disney+ outing is also its most disappointing."
Game of Thrones,0,"I don't think anyone can be happy that this season focused, in the end, on Jon Snow, the least complicated main character on an ensemble full of brutal instincts and grasping ambition."
Moon Knight,0,"The newest MCU series on Disney+ has some interesting ideas and cool authentically Egyptian flavor, but takes its own little time to get rolling."
The Pentaverate,0,The Pentaverate struggles under the weight of its main talent.
Casual,0,"Somehow... the series keeps from being overwhelmed by all the changes, either to its characters or the world around them, and winds up in delivering an emotionally satisfying end to one of Hulu's most charming and enjoyable series."
The OA,0,"The willing suspension of disbelief has to be earned, and from where I'm standing, The OA doesn't earn it."
Gaslit,0,"If the series accomplishes nothing else, it’s guaranteed to teach a few audience members stories they didn’t know before. It’s just too bad that in its messiness, Gaslit stops somewhere short of doing them justice."
Homeland,0,"Overall the first four episodes made available for review plod along... But then, just as I'm about to write off this final season, something happens at the end of the fourth episode that pulls me right back in. Just like Carrie, I can't seem to let go."
Amazing Stories,0,"The series might all be called Amazing Stories, But Not So Amazing That Heart Patients Can't Watch It."
"Web of Make Believe: Death, Lies & the Internet",0,While all of the subjects covered in the six episodes sound very interesting a lot of the oomph is taken out of them due to the repetitive and drawn out nature of each.
The Gilded Age,0,We know who these people are. They're clichés -- not unpleasant but wholly unsurprising.
Fear the Walking Dead,0,"Colman Domingo was as good as always, but all the exposition dumps and plot holes really dragged the [premiere] down, blunting what could have -- in more adept hands -- been a strong opener for Season Seven."
WeCrashed,0,"In declining to conjecture what WeWork’s nosedive meant for the rest of us, it’s got even less of a purpose than a co-working space during a pandemic."
Shadow and Bone,0,"'Shadow and Bone' is trying to show way too much in too little time, leaving its best intentions emotionally stunted and inert."
Big Shot,0,"Big Shot, while perfectly amiable in most respects, often fails to sweat the details in the way that a tough coach would demand."
Euphoria,0,"Euphoria is unrelentingly explicit this time around, as if it took one look at its former self and thought: no, not shocking enough, try this."
House of Cards,0,"With or without Kevin Spacey, it's possible that House of Cards had simply run its course. It's just a shame that it couldn't make one final sprint toward the finish line."
Weeds,0,Almost completely misses.
Shadow and Bone,0,"More exhausting than thrilling, Netflix's latest period fantasy adventure, ""Shadow and Bone,"" will have a tough time breaking out of the fan base already built by the books."
Teen Wolf,0,"While Stiles is missed in the last batch of episodes, this fun MTV show finds a nice way to say goodbye."
Mare of Easttown,0,"Gone are the days when HBO would produce only outright classics targeted at discerning audiences - in the streaming age, a wider clientele must be catered to."
The Wheel of Time,0,"How did Pike manage to keep up that sense of terrified, intense urgency, with all those boring plastic animals horsing around her? Where was all the swearing and off-colour shagging?"
Godless,0,"There are interesting ideas and some refreshing roles here, languorously trailed among the endless vistas. But these ideas flare and subside in the slow sprawl of the show, without the assurance of a guiding hand."
Killing Eve,0,"With only eight episodes in the series, it’s time to stop idling and hit the gas pedal. And new characters and errant plot threads only hinder what should be the driving force of the series, namely the Eve and Villanelle relationship."
Foundation,0,"As with some of Apple's other high budget series, the desire to look massive overtakes a lean narrative... This is probably the priciest slow burner show ever made."
Prison Break,0,"The reality is that Prison Break in 2017 is basically a collection of ideas that Homeland passed on, if you can imagine that."
Cardinal,0,The whole thing was so chilly that it left me craving a show that is the absolute opposite of this in every way: Death in Paradise.
The Outsider,0,"The stakes here seem to be massive; gradually, it becomes clear that an epidemic of darkness is overtaking many. But getting there, with so little in the way of character or freshness of tone, simply exhausts even an interested viewer."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,The Time Traveler’s Wife should probably have been left in the past.
WeCrashed,0,"Boy howdy if it doesn’t match former WeWork CEO Adam Neumann pound-for-pound on crappy decision-making, hapless showmanship, and missed opportunities to get back to basics."
House of Cards,0,It's eight-hours of filler to set up an immensely unsatisfying conclusion.
Bridgerton,0,"The show tries to tack on more substantive themes, while still ignoring the ways that its world-building has come up short."
The Twilight Zone,0,All over the map... Rod Serling had overworked himself into a state of total burnout from which he would never fully recover.
Prison Break,0,"The reality is that Prison Break in 2017 is basically a collection of ideas that Homeland passed on, if you can imagine that."
Marvel's Agent Carter,0,"You wouldn't be alone in feeling that this season of Agent Carter lacked a certain urgency...that's really the rub, that Season 2 never seemed like it had enough to say on Peggy's journey..."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"There is too much time to fill, too many episodes to stretch a fairly thin plot across, and too many goddamn strangers to stay interested in any one of them."
Joe vs Carole,0,"Though it's based on the Wondery podcast that first broke the tawdry tiger tale in 2019, Joe vs. Carole simply doesn't contain enough fresh insight to justify its existence today  despite game performances by the stars."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,Why borrow a classic if you're not going to do anything with it?
The Endgame,0,"The Endgame is by turns boring and by other turns generic and nonsensical. Its story isn’t compelling enough to follow beyond the first episode, and we’re figuring that the interplay between its stars isn’t enough to keep people watching."
The Big Conn,0,"The Big Conn bites off plenty, and occasionally more than it should chew, distending its scope to the point that it loses sight of Conn, whose over-the-top brazenness is the most interesting aspect of this saga."
Mr. Corman,0,Spending five-plus hours watching a very average man inch toward slightly greater self-awareness doesn't make for the most powerful TV experience.
Inventing Anna,0,"In trying to make the show about gossip and the media, Inventing Anna actually misses whatever it is that Anna herself was up to and rather focused on what she thought she was doing. Instead of adding complexity, it just comes off as muddled."
The Baby,0,"It should be weird and captivating! Instead, The Baby meanders..."
Monsters at Work,0,"Bafflingly, it's a workplace comedy. Note to Disney: children don't go to work."
Homeland,0,"Rven though the circumstances are new... it still felt like déjà vu. We have had this vibe, this dynamic before - many times."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Atill struggling with the same generic Marvel-on-Netflix issue: a master plot that just isn't dense enough to stretch over the episode order, leading to stop-and-start pacing, repetitive conversations and secondary characters that overstay their welcome."
You,0,"More and more, the show seems to be saying, Joe's struggles are just a slightly amped-up version of the viewer's own. He's ""You."" But there's too much grotesque violence in the show's past for us to relate to him, or to take the show on its own terms."
The Stand,0,"As rendered in this iteration of King's epic, that mix of realism and fantasy results in a disjointed, tonally inconsistent work that manages to both over-condense aspects of the original saga and overstay its welcome."
The Stand,0,"If you don't stand for something, you end up looking like a Walking Dead spin-off that never made it to the air."
Two and a Half Men,0,"I swear to God, I don't think I could come up with a worse ending."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,A disappointing bleak drama that doesn't have anything new to say.
Outer Range,0,A lot of people do good work on “Open Range.” If only it provided a little more to hold onto.
The Stand,0,"With its many subplots, some more compelling than others, it's an uneven series that's not so much a must-watch as a can-watch."
House of Cards,0,"By the time the last three episodes roll around, House of Cards' final season has abruptly buried itself in a whole host of weird, borderline anti-feminist tropes."
Midnight Mass,0,"Midnight Mass only really gets going in episode three. And, when it finally sets off, it doesn't seem to know where it is heading."
Killing Eve,0,"With only eight episodes in the series, it’s time to stop idling and hit the gas pedal. And new characters and errant plot threads only hinder what should be the driving force of the series, namely the Eve and Villanelle relationship."
1883,0,"For fans of westerns, 1883 certainly looks like the real deal, coming from Yellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan and featuring Sam Elliott as a gnarled cowboy. The execution, however, feels stale."
Arrested Development,0,No programme is more infuriatingly chuffed with itself.
Limitless,0,"Limitless comes off as rote, slick and bloodless.The show is based on the film of the same name and expect occasional Bradley Cooper drop-ins, but unless Limitless lives up to its name and starts achieving far more of its potential, I'll pass."
Guilty Party,0,"It's clear that Guilty Party has set out to spin a narrative about a complicated woman working a complicated case. But at this point in the story, the whole thing seems on the verge of buckling under one complication too many."
The Gilded Age,0,HBO hired Julian Fellowes to make a Downton Abbey out of 1880s NYC. But all the fussy costumes and jewelry in the world can’t bring The Gilded Age’s story of old vs. new money to life.
The Pentaverate,0,"Got some good laughs out of the first three episodes, but I grew weary."
Marvel's Agent Carter,0,It became... nothing more than a Hayley Atwell vehicle that let everything else from production value to narrative importance fall to the wayside if it meant the show's lead actress getting in just one extra spunky line of dialogue.
Halo,0,"The goal shouldn’t be about being everything to everyone, and while “Halo” treats the source material with respect, it does so with a tentativeness, as if it is afraid to miss a key element."
The First,0,"[Tom] acts like a complex hero in this post-""Sopranos"" era, but the aimless writing and the arty editing leave him flat."
The Endgame,0,"The Endgame is the sort of show that believes it can compete with an international hit like Money Heist by staging seven simultaneous bank takeovers, while giving us precious little reason to care what happens in any of them."
Severance,0,"If the series wants to tackle the exploitation of labor, even in its own exaggerated way, it usually helps when the authoritarians' methods of oppression make sense—logically and emotionally..."
Big Shot,0,"The lack of proper development for its teen girls is the most troubling aspect of ""Big Shot,"" all things considered, the element that feels the most performative."
The Lincoln Lawyer,0,"Despite some admirable efforts by its committed cast, this version of The Lincoln Lawyer never makes a compelling case for its lengthy and laborious existence."
Lincoln's Dilemma,0,"For the first 3 1/2 episodes, the filmmakers and contributing scholars do a reasonably good job of appearing unbiased...Where they drop the ball in a major way is in the last 15 minutes when their unabashed, vainglorious stripes are revealed."
Moon Knight,0,This hodgepodge of underdeveloped themes is augmented by run-of-the-mill action sequences that not only lack invention but also emotional thrust. Mohamed Diab’s first foray into Hollywood is a giant folly with a lot of promise and too little reward.
Shadow and Bone,0,Shadow and Bone could use some intimacy! Its conflicts as currently written are way too big and too abstract; its characters are too generic and undefined.
Shadow and Bone,0,"There are shows that flow cohesively and others that feel like several scenes meshed together, and 'Shadow and Bone' has many lost in the mesh."
Archive 81,0,"Netflix's new horror show Archive 81 offers promising scares and intrigue across the board, but in its execution, it forgets the most important thing: the characters."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"It's a deeply terrifying story of manipulation and abuse that plays like a comedy, sometimes when it doesn't mean to, but isn't all that funny when it's trying to be."
Lost,0,"Lost crashed, and crashed hard... This season wasn't a long con. It was a weak trick."
The Pentaverate,0,'The Pentaverate' is unbelievably bad.
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,"Winning Time is guaranteed to turn the stomachs of not only Boston Celtics fans, but anyone hoping for more than an egregiously cartoonish and ham-fisted hagiography executed with all the subtlety of a no-look pass."
24,0,"The contemporary anxiety 24 hopes to exploit this time around is of drones and of the increasingly dehumanized nature of warfare, but it has become a sort of dehumanized show, populated by barely human characters."
Devs,0,"Of course the characters don't have free will. That would require imagination, something Devs can only simulate."
Waco,0,"The show creates its own problems in telling this story, especially as it can't seem to handle the scope."
Devs,0,"It's probably a Marmite drama, but in its preoccupation with being clever-clever and abstruse, it has made its characters too insipid and humourless to give a monkey's about."
The Nevers,0,This weird mix of space and steampunk will confuse viewers rather than confound them.
Dr. Death,0,"Despite the show's few thrills, its structure only reveals an unsteady grasp of the story at its center."
A Wilderness of Error,0,"""A Wilderness of Error"" offers a not-so-illuminating message that it's sometimes difficult to get at the truth that's not worth the five hours it takes to hear it."
Bodyguard,0,Bodyguard adds to a long and damaging media trend of depicting brown people as terrorists.
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Despite able performers and potent themes, the show is so addicted to chaos that it squanders its chance to say anything substantive."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"While the strong ensemble cast made for a promising set-up, the series was besmirched by an increasingly infuriating script and a trite ending that had this viewer hurling decaying vegetables at the screen."
Ginny & Georgia,0,"The script's plotholes... [starts] so many stories that, in the dent, it doesn't end up providing the screen time that each one deserves. [Full review in Spanish]"
House of Cards,0,"House of Cards never quite maintains momentum, again; the first five episodes sent to critics are sometimes promising, sometimes plodding."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"It would, at this point, take a truly inspired interpretation to make a Time Traveler’s Wife series work. Sadly, this ain’t it."
And Just Like That...,0,"And Just Like That... A New Chapter of Sex and the City is a clumsy, cringe-inducing revival that fails to recapture the magic of the original."
Joe vs Carole,0,"Joe vs. Carole is competently made and entertaining enough but having already sat through the first season of Netflix’s bloated Tiger King, Joe vs. Carole can’t help but feel like a rerun of something I already saw."
Godless,0,"The show is filled with unnecessary rapes, voyeuristic violence against women, and frivolous female nudity."
Entourage,0,"Once fizzy and stuffed with A-list cameos, Entourage ends on a flat note and with a recurring role for Andrew Dice Clay."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"As in Once, the computer-generated landscapes and creatures don't quite work - they look unworldly, but in a cheesy way."
The First,0,"Only near the very end does ""The First"" strap in for another go, after viewers have endured far too much narrative flourish."
Big Shot,0,"If you're over ten years old, you've seen everything here before."
Inside Amy Schumer,0,"There are jokes about what it means to be an everyday woman, but they're sprinkled in among jokes about what it must be like to be Amy Schumer, and it messes with the voice of the show."
The Afterparty,0,"An Apple TV+ comedy series with one murder, plenty of suspects and minimal intrigue -- the sort of show that's modestly entertaining but doesn't bring enough to the party."
Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey,0,Treating this saga mostly as a shocking play-by-play with a reptilian boogeyman at the center feels a little cheap.
Twin Peaks,0,"""I am dead. Yet I live,"" [Laura Palmer] said. Much the same could be said of the revival, which resembles a danse macabre, full of familiar steps, but with some new missteps all of its own."
Suspicion,0,There’s not enough substance or character development here to hold our attention beyond the time it takes to click “NEXT.”
Lisey's Story,0,"The Apple TV+ limited series lands in the shallow end of the King cinematic pool, with a convoluted story that mostly squanders its big-name cast."
Halo,0,"Boasting no technological innovation to speak of, few performances to offer meaningful grounding and only limited action thrills, Halo is aggressively forgettable, which is at least several steps up from “bad.”"
First Kill,0,"The story is one you’ve definitely heard before, the leads lack chemistry, and the whole thing is lit like a deodorant commercial."
The Haunting of Hill House,0,"Like everything in Hill House, that terror gets muted, slowed down and picked over so much that it ends up banal and lifeless."
And Just Like That...,0,"I won't lie - at some level, it's nice to catch up with them. But it lacks the spark of Sex and the City. Now it's just another show."
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,0,"The show's attempt to individualize its protagonists largely reduces them to predictable, banal archetypes."
Severance,0,"If the series wants to tackle the exploitation of labor, even in its own exaggerated way, it usually helps when the authoritarians' methods of oppression make sense—logically and emotionally..."
The Pentaverate,0,"The Pentaverate rambles and repeats itself too often, even if the glimpses of Myers’ undeniable skill almost make it work and might be just enough for those who have missed him so."
Treadstone,0,Kring still hasn't figured out that momentum isn't the same thing as complexity...
11.22.63,0,No one would figure going back in time to spare the life of JFK would be easy or quick. But does it have to drag on so long and be this tiresome to watch?
Legion,0,Legion is weird for weird's sake and seems content to do that right up to the end.
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"It's meant as an episode of reflection, but because previous episodes have given the relationship a flimsy foundation, Scenes still ends on its flattest note."
Behind Her Eyes,0,It opts for a bizarre shock that's baffling at best and deeply tone-deaf at its worst.
Line of Duty,0,"As we embark on series six, a far greater problem is the weight of the past. As the plot races on, names and events float to the surface of my consciousness like something disturbing in a canal."
Mr. Corman,0,"The audience doesn't have to like the main character for the show to work, but at the very least, its center of gravity should be more nuanced and compelling than this one."
The Offer,0,"Strange pacing and unnecessary subplots bog down The Offer's more enjoyable moments, turning what could have been a thrilling look at movie history into an uneven television show."
We Own This City,0,"The six-part series isn't as rich as Simon's past work, in large part because it's built almost entirely out of rage. That's understandable -- but exhausting."
True Detective,0,"True Detective Season 3 is a little more workmanlike and less baroque, perhaps too eager to prove that it can tell a legible story again."
Invincible,0,"Invincible has the potential to become a better show, but only if the makers move beyond this adolescent mockery of a superhero series and into a zone of mature storytelling. The ingredients are already there. The mixing needs to be better."
13 Reasons Why,0,"Readers may recall how promising this show was at the beginning, when it was simply the adaptation of an acclaimed young adult novel... The final season reclaims only crumbs of that sensibility."
The Last Man on Earth,0,The Last Man on Earth remains very much on the bubble.
Our Flag Means Death,0,"Ultimately, it’s got enough amusing moments and talented performers to offer some comedic escapism once a week, but anyone looking for another “Shadows” or “Flight of the Conchords,” should sail to other waters."
The Offer,0,"While The Offer is an intermittently entertaining fictionalization about the making of the greatest movie of all time, your time would be far better spent re-watching the greatest movie of all time and the greatest sequel ever."
The Fall,0,"As good as Anderson is throughout, her Stella suffers from a Season 3 lack of development -- we learn nothing about her in this new season that we did not know from the previous two."
The Wire,0,"Though interesting at times, the fictionalized account of The Baltimore Sun lacks the depth of the institutions depicted in seasons past."
Gaslit,0,"The particularities of the way Nixonian paranoia played itself out over the national landscape defy easy comparison, and yet the show makes frequent, flat gestures towards the modern day."
Loki,0,"It's interesting to think and write about-a show that's about control, order, chaos, and the unknowable notions of free will, determinism, and choice-but mildly entertaining, at best, as a whole."
WeCrashed,0,"WeCrashed establishes that shameless hustlers worth billions, even when played by Academy Award winning movie stars, are not necessarily interesting people."
Brave New World,0,"As it unfolds, ""Brave New World"" fits only the most nebulous sense of the word ""interesting,"" with its most relevant commentary left behind in the Savage Lands."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,None of these characters speak like human beings.
Brave New World,0,Disastrously walked into every known pitfall of trying to turn what is essentially a philosophical discourse into gripping drama. Even mediocre drama would have been a start.
Guilty Party,0,"While a 30-minute dramatic series is often welcome, ""Guilty Party"" might have been better suited to a one-hour format that would allow Addelman and her team to flesh out the characters and their motivations as well as fine tune the tone."
The Twilight Zone,0,"Technophobic and misogynistic... you're better than this, Twilight Zone."
Stranger Things,0,"What we're left with is a disjointed poorer show. One that's trying to go in various directions, but doesn't always have the room for it, despite the crazy runtimes. I'm afraid Stranger Things 4 has gotten too big for its own good."
The Night Of,0,A show like this one is so busy saying something about the justice system and the prison-industrial complex that it rarely has a moment to consider that one of the injustices here is that a person was killed.
Night Sky,0,More of an exercise in frustration than anything else.
Mr. Corman,0,"Mr. Corman is billed as a ""comedy,"" somehow, but it's missing the laughs. It seems to be going for cringe comedy, but we just end up cringing. I felt more sad watching it than anything."
11.22.63,0,"Awkward and flat, never matching the promise of its premise."
Pieces of Her,0,"Toni Collette is a divine being sent from Heaven with whom we are all fortunate to share time on the same planet. Even Collette, however, cannot redeem what is one of television history’s most worthless characters in Netflix’s Pieces of Her."
We Own This City,0,"The six-part series isn't as rich as Simon's past work, in large part because it's built almost entirely out of rage. That's understandable -- but exhausting."
Twin Peaks,0,"""I am dead. Yet I live,"" [Laura Palmer] said. Much the same could be said of the revival, which resembles a danse macabre, full of familiar steps, but with some new missteps all of its own."
WandaVision,0,"The end product is comedically wan, the double-takes broad and all the Olsen/Bettany/Hahn charm squeezed into tiny dabs of screen time"
The Crown,0,"Duty may be life and pain for the royal family. But in The Crown, it's also ultimately spiritless."
Lovecraft Country,0,"Rather than weaving the elements of the show together to buttress each other, Lovecraft Country simply piles up a bunch of horror tropes for no discernible reason."
True Detective,0,"True Detective Season 3 is a little more workmanlike and less baroque, perhaps too eager to prove that it can tell a legible story again."
The Undoing,0,"Indeed, the show seems to relish the disorder that the Frasers cause in other people's lives, the pain they mete out. Throughout it all, the family remains static: glamorous, somehow still in control."
The Boys,0,"You finish each episode with a nasty taste in your mouth, not helped by the fact that so many of the characters are so ghastly you wish they’d all self-explode and put us out of our misery."
Good Sam,0,I'm as game as the next fan for a new House. This just isn't there yet.
Suspicion,0,There’s not enough substance or character development here to hold our attention beyond the time it takes to click “NEXT.”
The Shrink Next Door,0,"No expense was spared in building sets and procuring costumes that make the socioeconomic details of this story come through crisply, but both characters are, in the end, ciphers."
Taboo,0,"This tale sometimes feels like what might have happened if Sweeney Todd went after the East India Company, but it's weighed down by less-than-thrilling characterization."
Sex/Life,0,"Explicitness abounds. However, the friction that Sex/Life chases more often turns into a rub. As it turns out, both good sex and a good life can bloom when fed full-throated fantasy. But for Sex/Life, its soapy sexuality washes away its potential potency."
Ramy,0,"When it comes to the politics of Islam, supposedly one of the main focuses of the show, Youssef shies from delving into the growing division between secular and traditional Islam. It's here where the ideology of the show grows even more muddled."
The Undoing,0,"The Undoing has undeniably high production values and a top-notch cast, but they're in service of increasingly lackluster and inconsistent storytelling."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,It's much better paced and way easier to watch. But coming back from what was a truly lack-luster first season... was going to take a complete overhaul of the series and it's hard to say if that was ever going to be possible.
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"The best part about 9 Perfect Strangers is that the Wikipedia entry states up top ""not to be confused with Perfect Strangers."" Oh, how I wish that this were the tale of 9 Balkis..."
Jericho,0,"Well the good news is that the show is kinda-sorta ratcheting up the focus on the ""what happened"" story, plus it's looking more into how the country as a whole is dealing with its post-nukey self. The bad news is, I totally don't care anymore. At all."
Westworld,0,"The new season of often wayward drama doesn’t just treat many of the people onscreen as NPCs. Withholding to a fault and placing a wearying emphasis on misdirection, it leaves viewers in the dark."
Battlestar Galactica,0,A lot of basic and mundane things don't add up for me.
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"Bad wigs, limp characterization, indifferent plotting."
Godless,0,"Godless is so swept up in the romance of the West that it shortchanges practically everything else -- character, context, story."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,"McKay has entered... an Aaron Sorkin-esque level of directorial obtrusiveness, where a filmmaker’s tics and indulgences keep calling attention to themselves, distracting from the narrative at hand rather than amplifying it."
Castle Rock,0,"I can't tell if the new season is over-reaching, under-reaching or if the Annie Wilkes of it all is just overshadowing the story to an unanticipated degree."
Altered Carbon,0,"Altered Carbon has an amazing sandbox to work with, but the story doesn't always know how to play in it... The good news is that Season 2 ends on a note that could make Season 3 its best yet."
Pieces of Her,0,"Toni Collette is a divine being sent from Heaven with whom we are all fortunate to share time on the same planet. Even Collette, however, cannot redeem what is one of television history’s most worthless characters in Netflix’s Pieces of Her."
Stranger Things,0,The timing is terrible. The show itself gets slightly better from there.
Peacemaker,0,"""Peacemaker"" exposes a bigger problem: in a minor role with an ensemble of zany characters, Cena's witty banter felt like a breath of fresh air. In a eight-hour episodic series with lackluster supporting players, Cena struggles to carry the load."
Devs,0,A product that delivers neither the wildly creative sense of tech's possibilities nor the ground-level excavation of his characters... Devs is a misfire for a talented creator.
The O.C.,0,"As is perhaps fitting, though, for a show about teenagers and their notoriously short attention spans, the writers found it hard to keep up the momentum and the quality took a dive... It has been clear the show is on its last legs."
24,0,"24 is still fast-paced for the most part, although a little slow off the mark in its first hour. And the 47-year-old Sutherland remains trim and limber as an aging Jack of few words, most of them downers."
The Offer,0,"Unfortunately, the resulting product is frequently too on-the-nose. If there’s any reason to watch, it’s for the performance of actor Matthew Goode as legendary Paramount executive Robert Evans."
Shameless,0,Shameless fails many of its other characters when it comes to their conclusions. The series even does it in such a way where it feels like the show made a deliberate choice to avoid giving a solid ending to anyone's arc.
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,0,"As with most ventures like this, the total assembly is a very mixed bag of quality, dipping on the negative side of the ledger here overall."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,0,"Carrying those extra 15 minutes, ""The Problem"" drags; its monologues need honing, its jokes, if they stick around, need punching up, and its segments need to be trimmed down to the essence."
Marvel's Agent Carter,0,"You wouldn't be alone in feeling that this season of Agent Carter lacked a certain urgency...that's really the rub, that Season 2 never seemed like it had enough to say on Peggy's journey..."
Entourage,0,It struck me that the show seems even more like escapist candy than it did just a few years ago... Entourage stopped trying to even toy with realism or emotional depth.
The Office,0,Will those of us who've gradually fallen away return to see it out? I'm still not sure I will after seeing Thursday's Season 9 premiere
Bridgerton,0,Bridgerton season 2 is a lackluster season that hopes to recapture the heights of its first but mostly falls short.
The First,0,The First is never quite able to blast off.
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"Unless Alice and her rabbit pal have more tricks up their sleeve than Snow White and the gang could muster, ABC's visit to Wonderland might once again leave the network less in need of a looking glass than a rear-view mirror."
Prison Break,0,The nostalgia works against the show.
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"It's an admirable effort, but one that simply underscores how unadaptable this material might be -- the bottom line being that if time is indeed precious, these six episodes finally feel too much like a waste of it."
Interrogation,0,"Ultimately, not unlike the case explored by the detectives, accused killers, and put-upon lawyers of Interrogation, the show doesn't necessarily prove what it's actively trying to prove (crime dramas are interesting if you can choose your own fate)."
House of Cards,0,"Plans, schemes, endgames -- who has any use for those? The crazier Washington became, the more House of Cards lost its touch."
Shining Girls,0,"There’s good stuff here: Alongside Moss, Moura as the journalist aiding her, and Jamie Bell as the personification of human venality pursuing her, do fine work. But there’s simply not enough story here to make for a credible eight-episode series."
The Pentaverate,0,"Although its fantastic to have Mike Myers back in action, the series is underwhelming in elaborating its premise and comedy. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Gilded Age,0,We know who these people are. They're clichés -- not unpleasant but wholly unsurprising.
The Shrink Next Door,0,Mainly what held my interest in The Shrink Next Door was the myriad reasons it doesn't quite work.
Mr. Corman,0,"Mr. Corman is billed as a ""comedy,"" somehow, but it's missing the laughs. It seems to be going for cringe comedy, but we just end up cringing. I felt more sad watching it than anything."
Once Upon a Time,0,Once Upon a Time's magic is gone.
Foundation,0,"Spanning a millennium and juggling at least half-a-dozen narratives at any given moment, Foundation is suitably epic to behold, but has the emotional intensity of a lecture on particle physics."
Brave New World,0,"For the most part, we're left with an unsexy portrait of decadence, a thriller without thrills, a prescription that's less soma than Sominex."
Brave New World,0,"It's just never compelling, never engrossing and, worst of all, not thought-provoking to the degree it needs to be given its subject matter and acclaimed, if dated, source material."
Taboo,0,"... if you have ever wished to know what you get when too many alpha males gather in a room, perhaps this is it."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"If the plotting and the characters in The Mosquito Coast were more compelling, it wouldn't matter as much that Cross has ignored virtually every element of his source material."
House of Cards,0,"With or without Kevin Spacey, it's possible that House of Cards had simply run its course. It's just a shame that it couldn't make one final sprint toward the finish line."
The Shrink Next Door,0,The execution of the story doesn't feel balanced as an eight-episode series. It's oddly surface level at the same time never diving into the nuance or the complexities of how this could have happened.
X-Men,0,"Winding down, this series just wasn't as entertaining at the end as it was in the first few seasons"
Legion,0,"I responded to moments of Legion because I vibed with its project, but all of the aspects of that project ended up working better in other shows."
Bel-Air,0,"Suck all the joy, exuberance and wondrous charisma out of “The Fresh Prince” — a worthy launchpad for an actor who, in his prime, was widely considered the biggest movie star in the world — and you’re left with the gloomy and plodding “Bel-Air.”"
Archive 81,0,Is Archive 81 the silliest show on telly? Probably not -- but it certainly comes close.
Foundation,0,"""Foundation"" has the space for Asimov's seemingly endless plot points to breathe. Even so, it's much to take in, though creators David S. Goyer and Josh Friedman deserve kudos for making the effort at achieving the impossible."
Prison Break,0,"The reality is that Prison Break in 2017 is basically a collection of ideas that Homeland passed on, if you can imagine that."
The Offer,0,Its goofy failures create a veritable list of guidelines of how not to tell a story when otherwise trying to get across how hard it is to make a movie in Hollywood.
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Hulu trotted out Little Fires Everywhere, an eight-part limited series that attempts to capture the sprawling nature of the source material, but ultimately fails."
The Gilded Age,0,"Sadly, this show, with its cardboard characters, out-of-the-box costumes and obvious movie-set streets is all over the place. And don’t get me started on the bogus CGI architecture."
The Offer,0,"Viewers would be better off watching the Godfather saga, as its a better use of their time  and its far more entertaining than the entirety of this series."
The OA,0,"Events, characters and half-formed ideas are thrown at the screen then abandoned in favour of fresh mysteries, the show infinitely rolling out a carpet of kookiness."
Outer Range,0,"Outer Range has one of the worst momentum problems I've ever seen in a streaming show, squandering an evocative setting and some fun twists on portentous take-forever storytelling that prioritizes hints over character depth."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,0,"You can violate the laws of the universe you created, using a raft of new characters in whom we have no investment, or you can drag nine episodes' worth of doing so over 22 hours of TV. Not both."
Suspicion,0,"Suspicion still doesnt seem to know exactly what its saying, repurposing its more political source material into a series of middle-of-the-road thriller beats that are never as gripping as they aim to be."
A Wilderness of Error,0,"""A Wilderness of Error"" offers a not-so-illuminating message that it's sometimes difficult to get at the truth that's not worth the five hours it takes to hear it."
Rise,0,"When Rise shifts focus to one of Robbie's big games, it becomes painfully apparent how effortlessly Friday Night Lights stirred the emotions Rise struggles to find. It's not until the season finale that the show realizes its full tear-jerking potential."
Schmigadoon!,0,"Strong, who's one of the producers, is clearly having a ball, but Key is sold shockingly short by a lame script that starves him of funny lines and requires him to do nothing but moan."
The Haunting of Hill House,0,"Things were going so well. Now here I am, out back in the cold of night, burying it."
Entourage,0,"""Entourage"" seems to have undergone a certain loss of identity, at least on the evidence of the first few new shows."
Monsters at Work,0,"Has the feel of a weekday afternoon cartoon that was churned out quickly to capitalize on a successful property, featuring lesser versions of the franchise's characters."
Sex/Life,0,"The primary failing of Sex/Life is its inability to balance the acrobatic-romp and woman-finding-herself elements of its concept; there's so much of the former, and not enough of the latter."
Arrested Development,0,"You could forgive all this if these episodes were funny, if they contained even a trace of the spark that made its first run so incredible. But they aren't. They're flat and lifeless and pointless."
House of Cards,0,I doubt that I was the only one whose own lethargy gave her cause for revulsion.
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,The story fails to convince that the couple shares much more than an understanding of the obstacles keeping them apart. So much time is spent on establishing the rules of this show’s game that there’s little room to play.
The Right Stuff,0,The story crawls along incrementally without using all that time to let us know its characters as anything but the broadest of archetypes.
The Morning Show,0,"I liked that season one was a little campy. This season, however, summoned the ghosts of Joan Crawford, the cast of Grease 2, and Lady Gaga's Artpop era."
Inside Amy Schumer,0,"Schumer is as brazen and politically conscious as ever, but this season feels less personal and less urgent than last season...and more formulaic-sometimes even bordering on lazy."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"The show's skittish unwillingness to look hard at its characters for longer than a monologue dooms it -- not to failure but to a sort of absence, making a show about people in the fight for their lives feel like something to have on in the background."
Lisey's Story,0,"Lisey's Story is, on all fronts, too much. Too long, too over-produced, too many talents, too overwrought, too much going on."
The Bletchley Circle,0,"Instead of stroking suspense, the show starts and stops in fits, never finding a thrilling stride that unites the mysteries and deepens characterizations. Let's hope that Anna isn't on a permanent vacation."
House of Cards,0,This is the worst season of the series despite Robin Wright's best efforts. [Full Review in Spanish]
Hawkeye,0,"For a series about a pair of sharpshooters, Hawkeye frustratingly misses the mark too often. Well, at least for viewers who aren't its target audience."
Taboo,0,"This tale sometimes feels like what might have happened if Sweeney Todd went after the East India Company, but it's weighed down by less-than-thrilling characterization."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Nine Perfect Strangers suffers from the same chronic issue that so many television adaptations of juicy novels do: it fails to capture the sneaky, get-under-your-skin tendency of its engrossing source material."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"Once Upon a Time in Wonderland is a disappointment, focusing more on the chintzy tableau of the candy-colored Wonderland than on giving its actors anything interesting to do there."
The Book of Boba Fett,0,"Disney left its content farm out in Tatooines suns for far too long, a wilted mess of a commodity masquerading as a television show. What a sad showing, not just for Star Wars, but for art itself."
The Offer,0,"This Seventies flashback tries to hit a lot of marks at once... The only way it genuinely works, however, is as a parody of prestige TV."
Schmigadoon!,0,"There's too much talent here for Schmigadoon! to ever be a total waste, but the show is far more pandering than nurturing."
The Undoing,0,"Indeed, the show seems to relish the disorder that the Frasers cause in other people's lives, the pain they mete out. Throughout it all, the family remains static: glamorous, somehow still in control."
Night Sky,0,"After that first hour, you may be holding back tears. But after seven more, your eyes have glazed over, and even these luminous stars can’t bring you back to Earth."
Vigil,0,"According to the end credits, Vigil has been made with support from the Scottish government, which makes no secret of its opposition to nuclear weapons. That may hint at an extra political edge, but doesn't make this a compelling drama."
Arrested Development,0,No programme is more infuriatingly chuffed with itself.
Outer Banks,0,"If you don't want to broach the issue of race here, then don't tie the treasure to slavery. But if you're going to make that link, you have a responsibility to actually talk about it and the implications."
The Mysterious Benedict Society,0,"There could be potential here, but not enough to build real enthusiasm."
Two and a Half Men,0,"I swear to God, I don't think I could come up with a worse ending."
Stranger Things,0,It feels both overstuffed and slackly paced at the same time.
Roar,0,"In the end, the biggest problems with “Roar” may be failures not of the filmmakers, but of the medium itself. Some short stories simply work better on the page"
The Offer,0,"At 10 hours, the material is stretched absurdly thin, and it makes every flaw show."
The First Lady,0,"Once the “great woman behind the man” story line emerges as the show’s primary theme, “The First Lady” cannot help but seem hopelessly old-fashioned — and ill-timed for what already seems like a regressive moment for women in our nation."
Foundation,0,"The time jumps are confusing and the story needs a clearer arc. It doesn't feel immersive enough and, absent the texture of everyday life, the stakes feel too theoretical. The editing is clunky and the show lacks a sense of humor."
The Thing About Pam,0,"While providing superficial nods to Pam’s grievances, The Thing About Pam repeatedly recedes into a one-note character study, a regression only emphasized by Renée Zellweger’s exaggerated lead performance."
The First,0,"The show has a bland, sanitized feel, no matter how hard its cheesy score tries to heighten the inspiration at every turn. The best sci-fi stories, underneath the robots and space flights, are great human stories."
The Sopranos,0,"While it is one thing to flout the conventions of television, it's another to flip dramatic tradition, not to mention your audience, the bird."
WeCrashed,0,"This meaty showcase for Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway is wrapped in a somewhat malnourished limited series, with the misfortune of coming at the tail end of several better productions about high-stakes startups whose founders flew too close to the sun."
The Stand,0,"Unfortunately, the sabotage of the novel's truly enthralling story-telling leaves its ideology as its strongest element."
WandaVision,0,"As an exercise in cloning, it's all morbidly fascinating: The re-creations of the various classic shows and their styles display both a knowledge of and deep affection for old-time TV... But what was tedious then is tedious now."
Weeds,0,It felt like the Weeds finale could have been more focused and a bit more eventful.
Taboo,0,"This tale sometimes feels like what might have happened if Sweeney Todd went after the East India Company, but it's weighed down by less-than-thrilling characterization."
Lost,0,"Lost crashed, and crashed hard... This season wasn't a long con. It was a weak trick."
MacGruber,0,"It's hard to get excited for a sequel to a film that wasn't very good to begin with, especially when the sequel is three times as long."
The Nevers,0,To paraphrase Coco Chanel: This is a TV show that should look in the mirror and take off one plot point before exiting the house.
The First Lady,0,"There's never quite enough from any one first lady, which leaves a sense of disappointment. It's unfortunately a show that is lesser than the sum of its Emmy- and Oscar-winning parts."
True Blood,0,Headaches will be induced just in trying to unravel the plot mess Bon Temps finds itself in. At least this will be the last headache.
The Office,0,"And so NBC's The Office takes its leave, after overstaying its welcome and most often erring on the side of over-worked sentiment rather than pure comedy."
Servant,0,"Those who've been just as mystified, expecting a third season to answer the many questions it's raised, or at least a deeper dive following the supernatural events of the Season One cliffhanger, will be terribly disappointed."
And Just Like That...,0,Introducing a cross-section of different types of recurring characters -- love. Feeling like the series creators had a checklist of representation token boxes to check off... it's all trying way too hard -- hate.
Big Shot,0,"For a show about an ace competitor who finds joy in victory, Big Shot, stacking a canny hero against a universe of people who just don't get it, sure doesn't mind playing unfair."
Limitless,0,"Yet while Limitless is competently executed, what it lacks, finally, is any spark of inspiration. And alas, there's no pill for that."
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,"There's just too much stuff to really do justice to any of it, and that lack of focus makes it tough to latch on to anything the season is trying to do."
We Own This City,0,"The six-part series isn't as rich as Simon's past work, in large part because it's built almost entirely out of rage. That's understandable -- but exhausting."
Glee,0,Perhaps Ryan Murphy's most ruinous decision was to go all-out in his embrace of victimhood.
The Shrink Next Door,0,"The series rapidly hops between decades but feels like it moves at a crawl, dulling the myriad charms of its leading cast."
Girls,0,"For a show that started off so real to its target demographic, it didn't end that way."
Inventing Anna,0,"Inventing Anna transforms a juicy real-life drama about a con artist among the influencer crowd into a fairly inert limited series, in part by giving almost equal weight to the reporter who broke the story."
Brave New World,0,"The series looks gorgeous, and expensive, even if its sci-fi brutalist aesthetic is a bit generic. The performances are solid, too... Yet something is missing from the show's core... I struggled to get invested in this bunch."
Lost,0,Does this mean all of Lost counts for nothing? It's another question I can't answer.
Preacher,0,The back half of Preacher will have to pull a miracle out of the bag for this not to be remembered as a disappointment and a missed opportunity.
The Old Man,0,"The Old Man hits all the beats of a standard spy thriller and delivers some bone-crunching action, but the personal stuff falls flat. It strikes a meditative tone, without giving us much to meditate on."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Because the cast is so strong, they bring some poignancy to these roles... These are all intriguing personalities. Yet Kelley and his writing and directing team can't find a definitive lens to frame what the story is meant to convey about them."
Star Wars Resistance,0,"The bottom line is that Resistance... isn't really that good, or memorable. More specifically, it's a show that really doesn't know what it wants to be."
Looking for Alaska,0,"This is all pretty stiff, predictable stuff, built around the operatic pangs of teen romance."
The Right Stuff,0,"There's not a lot of wonder or enthusiasm to this version of The Right Stuff, which mostly treats the space program as a grim endurance test."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"If you are one of the approximately six people who didn't groan at the first season of this plodding, dull headache of a property, good news: You will also not hate the second one."
11.22.63,0,Feels like something ABC might have aired in 1997.
The Pentaverate,0,"Got some good laughs out of the first three episodes, but I grew weary."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,The Time Traveler’s Wife should probably have been left in the past.
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"The Punisher Season 2 isn't the worst season of Marvel TV on Netflix, but it's a pale shadow of its first season glory, and that's its biggest problem."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"If only one of these people would have the decency to drop dead, it would make the show infinitely more engaging."
WeCrashed,0,
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"The Punisher was a fun but undeniably flawed series, representative of the Netflix-Marvel universe as a model of frustrating inconsistency."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,0,"Carrying those extra 15 minutes, ""The Problem"" drags; its monologues need honing, its jokes, if they stick around, need punching up, and its segments need to be trimmed down to the essence."
The Night Of,0,"Actor/producer James Gandolfini's last project was meant to be a stirring indictment of the criminal justice system. Instead, it plays like an overwrought NYPD Blue episode."
House of Cards,0,"The final eight episodes, which are all available for streaming now on Netflix, comes to a messy conclusion with more loose ends than a Florida election ballot."
Invasion,0,"For all that money, we might have expected more. The plotting is occasionally a letdown too, bordering on infuriating."
24,0,"Despite the high-grade action, the premiere is more a showcase for everything that was bad about 24 than a reminder of everything that was good."
Prison Break,0,"More than a new installment of Prison Break, this season feels a bit like Homeland For Dummies, with the political intrigue and intelligence-community backstabbing brought down to a grade-school level."
The Morning Show,0,"Too often, The Morning Show's second season is satisfied with the easiness of shock -- of announcing itself, though not communicating much of note, in a blare."
Brave New World,0,"This adaptation looks great but is definitively hollow, and in turn all of its parties, extensive discussions, and choreographed orgy scenes become simply exhausting."
Moon Knight,0,Oscar Isaac can't salvage middle tier MCU entry.
True Blood,0,"I won't go so far as to say that True Blood's limping into its final season, but it's definitely anemic."
A Wilderness of Error,0,"Morris is asking us to consider an unlikely and generally unheralded possibility, and doing so in a manner so insistent as to make the proposition less and less appealing."
The Mysterious Benedict Society,0,"There could be potential here, but not enough to build real enthusiasm."
The Offer,0,"What unremarkably ensues is a kind of broad and tacky Godfather cosplay with zero subtext, nothing to say and very little to aspire to other than telling an increasingly self-satisfied tale of how The Godfather was made."
The Baby,0,"Haphazardly careens from one idea to another, throwing in themes and plot threads that never properly fit together."
Moon Knight,0,"The newest MCU series on Disney+ has some interesting ideas and cool authentically Egyptian flavor, but takes its own little time to get rolling."
Hellbound,0,An expendable attempt at a horror series that doesn't stand out. [Full review in Spanish]
The End of the F...ing World,0,Totally disappointing. [Full review in Spanish]
Arrested Development,0,"Unfortunately for the show, even without the controversies putting a cloud over proceedings, the simple fact of the matter is that this season just isn't that good."
And Just Like That...,0,"Theres still lots of ardor for New York City (which is nice, especially post-pandemic) in And Just Like That, but there is nothing sexy about it."
Night Sky,0,"Sissy Spacek and J.K. Simmons are powerhouses here, delivering poignant performances, and even carrying the weight when the show spirals into numbing nonsense."
Defending Jacob,0,Perhaps the biggest crime committed in Defending Jacob is that the elements to make this series pop are all there; they just weren't executed properly.
Pieces of Her,0,"If, like me, you want something deeper, you’ll find Pieces of Her’s biggest mystery will be how this tonally mismatched, structurally messy show came to be."
The Stand,0,"In 2021, when there's more content out there than any but the shut-in or chronically unemployed can hope to consume, being ignored - as The Stand deserves to be - is perhaps the unkindest fate of all."
Monsters at Work,0,It feels like a long wait at times. The first two half-hour episodes (the only ones of the 10 that were available for review) are extraordinarily slow.
24,0,"The Jack-as-wounded-hero archetype had been wrung dry long ago, and Live Another Day does nothing to find new life for it."
Sharp Objects,0,"The lead performance by Amy Adams as troubled reporter Camille Preaker keeps the show mostly watchable, but it's a chore to get through the dead-end subplots and the slow trickle of narrative developments that surround her."
Bodyguard,0,"Unfortunately, full of filler where there should be thriller, Bodyguard just can't get the job done, literally or figuratively."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"""Mayor of Kingstown"" appears tailor-made to be forever confused with 100 other shows like it, shackled and forgotten in its allegiance to an outdated template."
Wolf Like Me,0,"So bad it's good? No, just the former..."
Defending Jacob,0,Perhaps the biggest crime committed in Defending Jacob is that the elements to make this series pop are all there; they just weren't executed properly.
The Thing About Pam,0,"The thing about Pam, sadly, is that despite her crimes, she’s not all that interesting."
Lisey's Story,0,"There are some interesting, often supernatural connections between the characters; the hard part is wanting to stick around long enough to see where they might lead."
The Morning Show,0,"These cobbled together histrionic dramatics are offensive compared to the gravity of the issues of the first season. Even combined, the desperate scrambles of the second season don't have enough bite, or credibility, for the viewer to invest in."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,0,"Surprisingly, the comedy is the shakiest part early on... The second episode is more caustically funny but also more scattershot."
Outer Banks,0,"If you don't want to broach the issue of race here, then don't tie the treasure to slavery. But if you're going to make that link, you have a responsibility to actually talk about it and the implications."
Twin Peaks,0,"""I am dead. Yet I live,"" [Laura Palmer] said. Much the same could be said of the revival, which resembles a danse macabre, full of familiar steps, but with some new missteps all of its own."
Ozark,0,"When each scene is over, it evaporates in the perpetual churn of increasingly insupportable plot points."
The Essex Serpent,0,"A decent production budget and starry cast led by Tom Hiddleston and Claire Danes are squandered on a dreary, convoluted, portentous drama with all the appeal of a fog blanket over a giant rotting fish which someone briefly mistook for a dead dragon."
Arrested Development,0,It's hard to argue that the show's maintained the sly political relevance that elevated it during its initial run.
Suspicion,0,"By the time Suspicion reaches its heavy-handed conclusion, we hardly care who done it and why they did it."
Bel-Air,0,"Bel-Air is a glossy, expensive-looking soap that, like Fox’s Our Kind of People, puts the spotlight on uber-wealthy Black families. But “fresh?” Not so much."
The Boys,0,"Its bleak viewing experience might appeal to some audiences, but it’s likely to leave more than a few viewers wishing the entire cast of characters would just be put out of their misery."
A Teacher,0,It takes its sweet time getting anywhere and it's not an engaging trip. Both Ms. Mara and Mr. Robinson create characters who are sympathetic but also uninteresting; neither provides a reason to hang on.
Halo,0,I dont see much in these early episodes to make investing in a full season worthwhile. Halo does not come remotely close to any of the other sci-fi or fantasy series out there and represents yet another mediocre video game adaptation.
Rise,0,"Mr. Radnor is not convincing -- or he is, but in the wrong ways."
And Just Like That...,0,The show feels like it's trying to reverse-engineer itself through a lot of virtue signaling...
The Endgame,0,"The Endgame is by turns boring and by other turns generic and nonsensical. Its story isn’t compelling enough to follow beyond the first episode, and we’re figuring that the interplay between its stars isn’t enough to keep people watching."
Moon Knight,0,A series that ultimately feels rushed.
Dave,0,"Dave is still a biting satire set within the music industry that depicts the many pitfalls of making it to the main stage at Coachella. But especially this season, it's sometimes difficult to watch."
Lovecraft Country,0,"Generally, television shows are better served by declining to handhold their audiences through various twists and turns. But Lovecraft moves straight past 'trust the audience' and runs right into 'the audience can read our minds.'"
Taboo,0,"Taboo is a grubby, swollen TV gothic that has its moments but, aside from Hardy and some atmosphere, not much else."
The Endgame,0,"Morena Baccarin and Ryan Michelle Bathe, longtime supporting players getting starring roles in a large-scale series for the first time, do not feel irreplaceable, and the show's clunky, obvious writing doesn't give them much to work with."
House of Cards,0,What was once macabre is now mundane.
Bridgerton,0,"The real scandal of Bridgerton: Try as it might, it’s no substitute for Jane Austen."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,Adam McKay and John C Reilly join forces for a look back at the rise of the Lakers but strong performances can’t quite paper over a messy structure.
Wolf Like Me,0,Wolf Like Me takes its traumatic situation so seriously I kept waiting for it to let its hair down.
Losing Alice,0,"As a psychological drama, Losing Alice feels too self-conscious to be enjoyable or even provocative. Its inherent eroticism feels ill-earned only because Avin seems to be prone to sanitising the brazen fixations of his protagonists."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"The show's skittish unwillingness to look hard at its characters for longer than a monologue dooms it -- not to failure but to a sort of absence, making a show about people in the fight for their lives feel like something to have on in the background."
Halo,0,"iHaloi looks a lot like well you might expect an adaptation of the game would, but it fails to distinguish itself from similar sci-fi fare."
The Office,0,"Sorry, Dunder Mifflin, I might come back for your going-out-of-business sale (or whatever constitutes a not-so-grand finale), but for now, you're in fourth position in this time period once everything kicks into gear next week."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"Watching the story unfold, as Rudd's psychiatrist manipulates Ferrell's patient utterly and completely over the course of decades,is sometimes like scraping your knuckles on a cheese grater."
The First,0,"For a show about people looking up to the stars in wonder, its gaze is disappointingly earthbound."
WandaVision,0,It's like plugging through porridge for the chocolate button at the bottom of every bowl.
Pachinko,0,"While showrunner Soo Hugh cannot have had an easy task in finding the series within this sprawling, multigenerational novel, and while she conjures moments of immense power, and of connection, throughout, Pachinko does not, finally, cohere."
The Baby,0,"It should be weird and captivating! Instead, The Baby meanders..."
The Haunting of Hill House,0,"Most frustratingly, the adaptation abandons the raw feminine perversity that made Jackson's story so indelible."
Parenthood,0,"The writers' decision to go full cheeseball ending shouldn't have been surprising, after the show spent its last year turning into a frustrating shadow of itself."
Roar,0,"Mostly the stories hammer you over the head with their obviousness, then peter out."
Godless,0,I was excited for it... I think I fell asleep within the first 10 minutes of it. It was so unbelievably boring.
Rise,0,"The problem is, even with its many storylines, Rise's attempt at making the viewer a part of this small town's community, it is just too prescribed."
Entourage,0,"""Entourage"" seems to have undergone a certain loss of identity, at least on the evidence of the first few new shows."
Vigil,0,"According to the end credits, Vigil has been made with support from the Scottish government, which makes no secret of its opposition to nuclear weapons. That may hint at an extra political edge, but doesn't make this a compelling drama."
Halo,0,"The goal shouldn’t be about being everything to everyone, and while “Halo” treats the source material with respect, it does so with a tentativeness, as if it is afraid to miss a key element."
Mr. Corman,0,"Mr. Corman is billed as a ""comedy,"" somehow, but it's missing the laughs. It seems to be going for cringe comedy, but we just end up cringing. I felt more sad watching it than anything."
Arrested Development,0,"You could forgive all this if these episodes were funny, if they contained even a trace of the spark that made its first run so incredible. But they aren't. They're flat and lifeless and pointless."
Sharp Objects,0,"Vallée seems more interested in making everything look ""dark,"" rather than let his fantastic actors take us through their emotional journey."
Love Life,0,"No matter how much you can appreciate the character's journey, it's not easy for any actor to carry this type of story, but Harper would make you believe otherwise. Here's hoping he gets even better material moving forward."
Vigil,0,"The artificial, strained, implausible plot twists and turns come and go, giving the Sunday night BBC TV audience their fix of ersatz tension and brainwashing."
Monsters at Work,0,"As someone who loves the films, I wonder ... do we need more of it? The films are so well self-contained. This feels like an excess of something we don't really need."""
Lisey's Story,0,"Despite Moore's earnest performance, the show gets stuck in a twilight zone between hokey and horrifying. It ultimately comes to resemble a ponderous, misshapen beast, much like the one that haunts Boo'ya Moon."
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,"That's a close metaphor for season 2, in that a prominent adaptation of a beloved comic property invites more scrutiny, and it's a shame it doesn't deliver."
Boardwalk Empire,0,"For its final season, the show seems to want to bring the focus back onto Nucky, but as usual there's no particularly compelling reason to care about what happens to him."
The Book of Boba Fett,0,"The spinoff of 'The Mandalorian' had an opportunity to expand what it meant to be a 'Star Wars' story, but it's consistently stopped right at the edge of actual exploration."
The Stand,0,"If you don't stand for something, you end up looking like a Walking Dead spin-off that never made it to the air."
The Thing About Pam,0,"Even over six episodes, this series is far too long and not worth the effort that Renee Zellweger puts into playing the title character."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"The real star of this woeful, pointless television programme is its toxic gender and sexual politics."
Waco,0,More notable for its casting than its execution.
Dave,0,"Dave is still a biting satire set within the music industry that depicts the many pitfalls of making it to the main stage at Coachella. But especially this season, it's sometimes difficult to watch."
WeCrashed,0,"WeCrashed establishes that shameless hustlers worth billions, even when played by Academy Award winning movie stars, are not necessarily interesting people."
Devs,0,"While I can appreciate the stark beauty of the series, there is a pervading sense of dread that I found thoroughly unpleasant... Devs feels like the kind of show that will be a game-changer for many. But I'm not one of them."
Black Sails,0,"Though there are hints of better things to come, the early goings of Black Sails season 4 are light on fun and adventure."
WeCrashed,0,I think we could all use a little Jared Leto break.
Midnight Mass,0,"They could have just gone so much further with... the mysticism, the miracles, and even the backstories of these characters."
Brave New World,0,"Huxley's novel was revolutionary when it was published nearly 90 years ago, but the show has turned it into just another piece of consumer content."
Marvel's Agent Carter,0,"Get past the surface, though, and it once again looks as if the show has been relegated to the role of little more than handsome placeholder to break up SHIELD's season - all dressed up, perhaps, but as outfitted, with no real place to go."
Mr. Corman,0,"Stop me if you already saw this indulgent indie flick back in the early 90s, because trust me -- you did."
Lovecraft Country,0,"A by-the-numbers story that wants to be bold and daring, and in so doing ends up not engaging with its own strongest elements."
The Mist,0,"Okay, it's possible I'm overreacting here just a smidge. But Spike's version of The Mist is one dumb piece of work."
The Beatles: Get Back,0,"The Beatles: Get Back only truly comes to life when the eponymous band performs, and it happens far less than you might want over the course of 8 hours."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,0,"While I was happy to see Estevez on screen, the character is flat and unpleasant, giving little explanation about his backstory until episode three."
And Just Like That...,0,"We recognize these characters, but it's not just someone at the table who's missing - it's an energy."
Mr. Corman,0,I wonder with Joseph Gordon-Levitt wearing too many creative hats that he's juggling too many ideas both with the storytelling and the creative vision to keep up emotional drive within the series.
Lisey's Story,0,"The porousness of the action becomes frustrating and, ultimately, off-putting. I don't mind being toyed with by a show; I don't need strict linearity. But the willful swirl and the withholding of coherence are too extreme here."
Killing Eve,0,"Fourth time around, the sense is of having spent too long on a carnival ride. Nausea is kicking in."
Sweet Tooth,0,"The show turns Jeff Lemire's lurid comic into a childlike adventure, but it loses the complexity, the ugliness, and the raw emotion that made the saga so rich in the first place."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"The Shrink Next Door has plenty of star power but can't get past its confused narrative, disappointing lack of character development, and dragging pace."
Earth to Ned,0,Alien puppet talk show falls short of Muppet expectations.
WandaVision,0,"As an exercise in cloning, it's all morbidly fascinating: The re-creations of the various classic shows and their styles display both a knowledge of and deep affection for old-time TV... But what was tedious then is tedious now."
The First,0,"Sluggishly paced and too familiar in its character beats, it's the sort of prestige project that surely looked good on paper but fizzles once exposed to air."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,This could have been eight episodes.
And Just Like That...,0,"Samantha Jones's perverted yet sensible energy was what kept this show together, and without her, these women are in big trouble."
The Shrink Next Door,0,The execution of the story doesn't feel balanced as an eight-episode series. It's oddly surface level at the same time never diving into the nuance or the complexities of how this could have happened.
The Office,0,"There's some symmetry in the fact that after eight years, four Emmys, three regional managers, and an untold number of parties in the conference room, The Office's farewell feels more like an afterthought than an event."
The Book of Boba Fett,0,"Disney left its content farm out in Tatooines suns for far too long, a wilted mess of a commodity masquerading as a television show. What a sad showing, not just for Star Wars, but for art itself."
The Offer,0,"This Seventies flashback tries to hit a lot of marks at once... The only way it genuinely works, however, is as a parody of prestige TV."
Bridgerton,0,"The show tries to tack on more substantive themes, while still ignoring the ways that its world-building has come up short."
Inventing Anna,0,"Inventing Anna transforms a juicy real-life drama about a con artist among the influencer crowd into a fairly inert limited series, in part by giving almost equal weight to the reporter who broke the story."
X-Men,0,"Winding down, this series just wasn't as entertaining at the end as it was in the first few seasons"
Boardwalk Empire,0,"For its final season, the show seems to want to bring the focus back onto Nucky, but as usual there's no particularly compelling reason to care about what happens to him."
Mad Men,0,The season premiere seems as exhausted as the decade it has chronicled so intensely.
Ginny & Georgia,0,"Ginny & Georgia winds down its punishingly long first season having shouted a great deal, but said almost nothing at all."
The First,0,"Sluggishly paced and too familiar in its character beats, it's the sort of prestige project that surely looked good on paper but fizzles once exposed to air."
Brave New World,0,"It's just never compelling, never engrossing and, worst of all, not thought-provoking to the degree it needs to be given its subject matter and acclaimed, if dated, source material."
WeCrashed,0,"In general, the series is a bit like the neon ""Hustle Harder"" signs that adorn the WeWork offices we see here -- flashy but vague."
Riverdale,0,"special events are not canon, which means that it's all a meaningless stunt designed to incorporate The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina into Riverdale and give K.J. Apa fans a brief heart attack."
Ramy,0,"When it comes to the politics of Islam, supposedly one of the main focuses of the show, Youssef shies from delving into the growing division between secular and traditional Islam. It's here where the ideology of the show grows even more muddled."
Bridgerton,0,"As soaps go, one can certainly do worse than Bridgerton, but season two... feels like a bland mimeograph of season one."
The Me You Can't See,0,"There is no doubt that every contributor's motives here were pure. But standing outside and looking at the programme as an artefact and an influence on debate, one might ask whether sharing stories always means giving back"
The Gilded Age,0,It comes at you like an undulating wall of plastinated velvet. Watch a single minute of any of this overstyled nine-part period monstrosity about rich American families and you will end up gasping: what is this gopping Edith Wharton-style product?
Looking for Alaska,0,"This is all pretty stiff, predictable stuff, built around the operatic pangs of teen romance."
Arrested Development,0,"The meandering plot sucks the charm from everything. The characters feel oddly as though they don't get to exhibit or develop the traits we know them by, as they're usually too busy rattling off exposition."
The Wilds,0,"The end result is a season that is overstuffed and yet drags, as though the boys sucked all the energy out of the first season, as they do."
Sons of Anarchy,0,"While it will be interesting to see the way Sons tackles loose ends, in terms of how the series explores shades of gray, it looks like it's all over but the shooting."
Archive 81,0,Is Archive 81 the silliest show on telly? Probably not -- but it certainly comes close.
Loot,0,"It’s only thanks to Rudolph’s ability to balance winsomeness, befuddlement, and sincerity that Molly isn’t utterly infuriating, and even with that in mind, Loot overestimates how much of the character viewers will be willing to tolerate."
Lovecraft Country,0,"Pulp horror stories are best consumed in a single, quick encounter, before their limitations of plot and characterization become too obvious to ignore. Lovecraft Country is reduced to one of the walking dead long before its final credits roll."
Tokyo Vice,0,"In an overabundant genre where story lines tend to follow the familiar beats of an investigation, viewers have to care about the hero. And that’s tough when his inner life is given minimal attention."
Arrested Development,0,"But resurrecting all of the previous season's complicated plotlines in one episode comes with its own consequences. Check your lease, Netflixers, because you're living in Flashback City."
Bel-Air,0,"It’s one thing to ask whether it would be great if the Fresh Prince premise was used in service of a grittier, more dramatic take on the story; it’s another to make that twist work over the long haul."
The Nevers,0,"This is really unpleasant, and that is all I have."
Riverdale,0,"special events are not canon, which means that it's all a meaningless stunt designed to incorporate The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina into Riverdale and give K.J. Apa fans a brief heart attack."
What If...?,0,"For a series set in the infinite vastness of a multiverse, What If...? is dreaming awfully small."
The Twilight Zone,0,"One of the major issues of Peele's debut season was the runtime for episodes. This season is no exception, and of the three episodes screened, only one truly earns the extra half-hour - and even then, it could easily be chiseled down."
Devs,0,"Garland's vision is in the forefront here, and the result is a limited series with a frosty emotional tone, and a story heavy on cutting-edge techno-speak, but skimpy when it comes to characterization."
Midnight Mass,0,"While some of the show's themes are talked to death, others wither away, undeveloped."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"If The White Lotus is 30 Rock, then Nine Perfect Strangers is Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip: not ""good,"" exactly, and definitely way overblown, but still watchable in its own strange way."
Limitless,0,"There's a story to be told about what it means to be human in a tech-wild, catastrophe-rocked, profoundly uncertain age. Maybe someday, TV will give us that story. Until then, we get generic label pop like Limitless."
Minx,0,It feels like a real missed opportunity that “Minx” is so unwilling to question its own assumptions: that porn is good; that feminism must be fun; and that capturing the White female moneyed gaze is the ultimate marker of the magazine’s success.
Angelyne,0,I liked “Angelyne” better as it went on... without ever being wholly convinced that it was a trip I needed to take.
The First,0,"It's a series that's all countdown, but no launch."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,0,"Part of that may be because of the vitality of its guests, Jenifer Lewis and Bassem Youssef. Maybe ""the problem"" with the series is Stewart himself."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Sometimes it seems to be a lampoon of New Age self-help fads; other times, an encomium to self-lacerating encounter-group culture; and occasionally, a creepy stalker drama. These are not the makings of a good jigsaw puzzle."
The Baby,0,"Haphazardly careens from one idea to another, throwing in themes and plot threads that never properly fit together."
Sex and the City,0,"I got to wondering: didn't we reach a climax in our relationship with Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda sooner than any of us would dare to admit?"
Station Eleven,0,"In the end, ""Station Eleven"" may be too attached to its rose-colored glasses."
Prison Break,0,This was most definitely not the way I wanted nor expected season five to get underway. But here's hoping somehow the show is able to catch its footing because Ogygia was a complete and utter letdown.
And Just Like That...,0,"Far too many 2021 cultural touchstones and new characters are awkwardly parachuted into the luscious looking Michael Patrick King executive produced revival of sorts, as if to check a box."
Godless,0,"Godless foregrounds by-the-book gunslingers and manhunts that take a promising concept and translate it into familiar, if handsomely presented, clich."
The Offer,0,"There's some good and bad with this... but at a certain point, you think ""Why am I watching a miniseries about The Godfather when I could be watching The Godfather?"""
Monsters at Work,0,It feels like a long wait at times. The first two half-hour episodes (the only ones of the 10 that were available for review) are extraordinarily slow.
11.22.63,0,"The resulting eight-part miniseries is an uneven affair, at times feeling as if it's meandering through history en route to its frantic closing kick."
Y: The Last Man,0,"While some intriguing & important new elements are added, like Elliot Fletcher's trans character, the show is so concerned with big ideas it neglects all of its characters."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"""Something something daddy issues"" is a perilously slender thread from which to hang an entire scripted drama, and perhaps that's why the show feels so sterile."
The Morning Show,0,It's baffling how a series with such a talented and star-studded cast managed to bypass prestige drama and land in the realm of soap opera.
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,An incredibly frustrating story that never quite brings all of its ideas home.
Servant,0,"Those who've been just as mystified, expecting a third season to answer the many questions it's raised, or at least a deeper dive following the supernatural events of the Season One cliffhanger, will be terribly disappointed."
Brave New World,0,"Huxley's novel was revolutionary when it was published nearly 90 years ago, but the show has turned it into just another piece of consumer content."
Waco,0,"Waco won't be the first drama to reduce a tragedy to its simplest components, but this doesn't offer much confidence that these are the right components or the only ones."
Entourage,0,"""Entourage"" seems to have undergone a certain loss of identity, at least on the evidence of the first few new shows."
Sharp Objects,0,Sharp Objects scratches the surface of being interesting but can't overcome its dull edges.
Marvel's Agent Carter,0,It became... nothing more than a Hayley Atwell vehicle that let everything else from production value to narrative importance fall to the wayside if it meant the show's lead actress getting in just one extra spunky line of dialogue.
Inventing Anna,0,"Like Delvey herself, “Inventing Anna” is all flash with little substance — offering little insight into this enigmatic figure."
The Old Man,0,"The Old Man hits all the beats of a standard spy thriller and delivers some bone-crunching action, but the personal stuff falls flat. It strikes a meditative tone, without giving us much to meditate on."
Star Wars: Visions,0,"If ""Star Wars: Visions"" does nothing else, it at least tells the story that, if only in part it's an important part, that the long time ago and the galaxy far away was maybe the Tokugawa era in feudal Japan."
The Undoing,0,"A bad man getting away with a bad thing? Lawyers obfuscating the wheels of justice? It's all too familiar. And perhaps this is just 2020 talking, but it's a little exhausting, too."
Night Sky,0,"Simmons and Spacek give great performances but it’s unfortunately not enough to keep Night Sky from being a dull, boring, and forgettable show."
Friends,0,"Even the kiss that cemented Ross and Rachel couldn't disguise the show's larger anti-climax, a cop-out from the logical conclusions of the show's premise, conclusions it began to acknowledge only to ultimately deny their existence."
Twin Peaks,0,"The show, which derived its power from the aftermath of trauma in a small community, has chosen to tell a story that's odder and bigger -- so big, in fact, that it has so far choked off what made Twin Peaks work all along."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"I'd watch these characters all day under the simplicity of a spotlight and a monologue, free from the pretentious packaging. It's a shame that the show seems to get hit with a tranquilizer dart after the first couple of episodes ..."
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,0,"The show feels like more Star Wars: Clone Wars, and yet never reaches the heights that it's sister series did, and ultimately doesn't find it's own voice as a result."
Defending Jacob,0,Defending Jacob feels like a huge miss for Apple TV+.
Shadow and Bone,0,The storytelling in this adaptation from showrunner Eric Heisserer (Bird Box. Arrival) fails to establish and maintain a momentum nearly as powerful as some of the show's magic.
Euphoria,0,"Euphoria is unrelentingly explicit this time around, as if it took one look at its former self and thought: no, not shocking enough, try this."
Roar,0,"While stylish and provocative, the series ultimately falls a little flat in its message. If a woman’s plight is to suffer, then Roar doesn’t end up giving its women a way out."
The Boys,0,"Three seasons in, the gag is starting to grow a bit old, as the satire gets weaker and more toothless and more characters vie for our attention while traveling down familiar roads."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"The Time Traveler's Wife focuses so much on the time travel element, it fails to build the relationship between the lead characters, which should be the heart of the series."
Dave,0,"Dave is still a biting satire set within the music industry that depicts the many pitfalls of making it to the main stage at Coachella. But especially this season, it's sometimes difficult to watch."
Lisey's Story,0,"Apple's Stephen King Miniseries Starts Off Strong, Only to Quickly Fall Apart."
Lisey's Story,0,"Despite the involvement of starry names in front of and behind the camera, intriguing fantasy elements and fascinating themes, the show never achieves the resonance it seems to be reaching for"
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,What’s left is a show filled with so much hatred and ickiness it’s hard to believe anyone will find something to enjoy lurking inside all this muck.
The Fall,0,"As good as Anderson is throughout, her Stella suffers from a Season 3 lack of development -- we learn nothing about her in this new season that we did not know from the previous two."
Pretty Little Liars,0,"In its seventh season, Pretty Little Liars illustrates the dangers of stretching a mystery as far as it can go with a splashy premiere that fails to establish real stakes for its characters."
Catastrophe,0,"It's often snobby and more than occasionally mean. It has a thin, subtle story, and lacks memorable set pieces."
Lost,0,Does this mean all of Lost counts for nothing? It's another question I can't answer.
A Wilderness of Error,0,Morris' book meticulously chronicled a wilderness of errors. All Smerling's documentary does is get lost in a wilderness of voices.
Altered Carbon,0,"The ideas behind the premise are so good, the potential to examine existential issues about identity and humanity and how they're tied up in our physical form are so great, that it's frustrating to see how often the show takes a too-shallow approach."
Boardwalk Empire,0,"These great clunking scenes are not only dull and unnecessary, they also draw unwanted attention to Boardwalk's greatest weakness. Empathy can't be retconned. It has to be earned."
The Haunting of Hill House,0,"Like everything in Hill House, that terror gets muted, slowed down and picked over so much that it ends up banal and lifeless."
Friends,0,"The ""Friends"" soap opera ended predictably and blandly last night, with no big surprises, just two little ones -- Monica's and Chandler's twins."
And Just Like That...,0,"Modernizing the original's much-beloved and extremely glamorous world has for some reason meant making it drearier, more awkward, and overall less joyful to inhabit."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"""Marvel's Jessica Jones"" gets off on the wrong foot in Season 3 and stays there until the lackluster end."
True Detective,0,Mahershala Ali is the most notable thing about this third season that desperately tries to imitate the first season. [Full Review in Spanish]
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Atill struggling with the same generic Marvel-on-Netflix issue: a master plot that just isn't dense enough to stretch over the episode order, leading to stop-and-start pacing, repetitive conversations and secondary characters that overstay their welcome."
Vikings: Valhalla,0,"Valhalla isn’t terrible. But it feels mostly like more of the same, without having much of an identity to itself. In a crowded landscape, that doesn’t give it a lot to fight for."
Losing Alice,0,"It might have worked effectively as a 3-hour movie, but at 7 hours doled out over eight episodes, Losing Alice dribs and drabs, but mostly drabs."
The Umbrella Academy,0,"This is the most apocalyptic-y apocalypse ever, but it carries no real weight. Then when you find out what has to be done to save the universe, it just feels very underwhelming. Samurais, really?"
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"If you enjoyed season 1 you'll be perfectly happy with this addition, but it doesn't do anything interesting with a character who should feel more relevant to our current political climate."
What If...?,0,"[What If...? is] bite-sized chunks of comic book fun, however [the show doesn't] go further than being half-hearted fan service."
Mare of Easttown,0,"It's nice that HBO has turned out another handsomely produced, manifestly serious mini-series for the wonderful actress Kate Winslet. It would be nicer if those series were worth her time and talent."
True Blood,0,"In its final season, the series seems to have exhausted its stores of surprises."
The White Lotus,0,"Aside from a subplot involving cultural reparations that doesn't entirely land, it would have been nice to see a bit more exposition about what point ""The White Lotus"" is ultimately trying to make."
WeCrashed,0,"Its strong start meanders to [a] repetitive, inevitable end."
Killing Eve,0,"Ever since the series’ first season, Killing Eve has been stuck in a weird holding pattern when it comes to these characters... And in the final season, don’t we -- and these characters -- deserve more?"
WeCrashed,0,"Its strong start meanders to [a] repetitive, inevitable end."
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"It's meant as an episode of reflection, but because previous episodes have given the relationship a flimsy foundation, Scenes still ends on its flattest note."
The Summer I Turned Pretty,0,"The series, which evokes YA soaps like The OC and Gossip Girl, is pleasant enough, if blandly formulaic: full of breathless kisses, swim suits, dances, and mood-supporting pop songs - plus boozing, hooking up, and cheating, bathed in fumbling innocence."
30 Rock,0,"Anyone returning, hoping for the old Rock rather than the new, is bound to be disappointed in this strained outing."
The Offer,0,The depictions of real-life actors border on mimicry... The various Mafia personages appear to have watched The Godfather once too often.
Defending Jacob,0,"Defending Jacob suffers greatly from its format, stretching 120 minutes of story max into eight hours of episodic television."
Love Life,0,"No matter how much you can appreciate the character's journey, it's not easy for any actor to carry this type of story, but Harper would make you believe otherwise. Here's hoping he gets even better material moving forward."
His Dark Materials,0,"For a story centered on the exploits of a frightened, isolated teenager, the show remains remarkably devoid of any sense of fear, excitement, or passion."
WandaVision,0,"Disney Plus's new Marvel show WandaVision promises a surreal spin on a 1960s sitcom reality. But so far, it's delivered little more than winks and nods to Marvel Cinematic Universe loyalists."
The Wheel of Time,0,"The action, when it comes, is lively, if predictable, but The Wheel of Time buckles under chunks of tedious exposition."
Defending Jacob,0,Defending Jacob feels like a huge miss for Apple TV+.
The Wheel of Time,0,"There are worse fantasy series and films out there, to be sure, but none of them were dumb enough to give their monsters a name that rhymes with ""bollocks""."
30 Rock,0,"Anyone returning, hoping for the old Rock rather than the new, is bound to be disappointed in this strained outing."
Catastrophe,0,"It's often snobby and more than occasionally mean. It has a thin, subtle story, and lacks memorable set pieces."
Peacemaker,0,"""Peacemaker"" exposes a bigger problem: in a minor role with an ensemble of zany characters, Cena's witty banter felt like a breath of fresh air. In a eight-hour episodic series with lackluster supporting players, Cena struggles to carry the load."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,0,"You can violate the laws of the universe you created, using a raft of new characters in whom we have no investment, or you can drag nine episodes' worth of doing so over 22 hours of TV. Not both."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Anatomy of a Scandal struggles to thread the needle between [its] two impulses, resulting in a show that’s unsatisfying as either a lurid thriller or a serious drama."
Servant,0,"Those who've been just as mystified, expecting a third season to answer the many questions it's raised, or at least a deeper dive following the supernatural events of the Season One cliffhanger, will be terribly disappointed."
The Twilight Zone,0,"For its final episode, The Twilight Zone gives us something it spent most of its time railing against: a happy ending of perfect, selfish bliss."
Little Voice,0,Never tries something original when a cliché will do instead.
Looking for Alaska,0,"""Looking For Alaska"" is nostalgic for itself, like it's admiring itself in a mirror instead of making eye contact. This neutralizes the immediacy and intimacy that can make coming-of-age stories so special."
His Dark Materials,0,With so much time taken up with gabbing there was little left for the kind of spectacle that made the first series a hit.
Tokyo Vice,0,"After that first episode ends, and Mann hands off the show to other directors, an impression starts to build that the best ""Vice'' has to offer is behind it."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"The way Ike silkily asserts control over Marty's life, and why Marty was susceptible to it, is a key element to all of this. But the show's approach is weirdly miscalculated."
Looking for Alaska,0,"This is all pretty stiff, predictable stuff, built around the operatic pangs of teen romance."
Inventing Anna,0,"Rhimes isn't shy about availing herself of artistic license. In this story, however, she forgoes fleshing out her characters and bloats each episode's runtime instead."
The First Lady,0,"Watching the series attempt to make sense of itself, it’s tempting to believe that it began as three separate Michelle, Betty, and Eleanor shows before The First Lady slapped them together into one."
Sharp Objects,0,Sharp Objects scratches the surface of being interesting but can't overcome its dull edges.
The Queen's Gambit,0,"It is a show that takes itself so seriously that, when former child actor Thomas Brodie-Sangster turns up dressed like an escapee from the Wild West, you don't know whether it's meant to be funny or not"
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,My real problem with Scandal isn’t that it’s trashy or muddled in its message. I was mostly lost wondering who to care about... What’s really missing in this Anatomy lesson is its soul.
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,It's all meant to be a paean to the imagination. Too bad the effects pry some of us out of our imaginations and into the tech lab.
The Thing About Pam,0,The Thing About Pam offers an intriguing but tonally off-putting rehash of a familiar true crime story.
The Shrink Next Door,0,"Watching the story unfold, as Rudd's psychiatrist manipulates Ferrell's patient utterly and completely over the course of decades,is sometimes like scraping your knuckles on a cheese grater."
Slow Horses,0,This spy thriller hitches its wagon to an insufferable performance.
The Morning Show,0,"After watching Season 2, I struggle to be certain what this show is about. The answer, at this point, really isn't ""a morning show."""
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,Iron Fist's sophomore season isn't able to right the many wrongs from its first. Don't waste your time on this one.
The Flight Attendant,0,"I never understood the appeal of The Flight Attendant, and I still don't."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Despite able performers and potent themes, the show is so addicted to chaos that it squanders its chance to say anything substantive."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"It's a deeply terrifying story of manipulation and abuse that plays like a comedy, sometimes when it doesn't mean to, but isn't all that funny when it's trying to be."
24,0,Live Another Day feels terribly dated.
Snowflake Mountain,0,"Part reality competition and part train wreck, this is a formulaic series produced to make its cast look pathetic."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,My real problem with Scandal isn’t that it’s trashy or muddled in its message. I was mostly lost wondering who to care about... What’s really missing in this Anatomy lesson is its soul.
Sharp Objects,0,"There is much to recommend Sharp Objects: its visual language is rich and fugal (blades, pigs, fans recur) and rewards close watching. But the dissatisfaction of the show's conclusion speaks to a larger confusion in the aim of the series."
The Stand,0,"As rendered in this iteration of King's epic, that mix of realism and fantasy results in a disjointed, tonally inconsistent work that manages to both over-condense aspects of the original saga and overstay its welcome."
The Beatles: Get Back,0,Seven hours of boredom that test the beatlemania of the most devoted beatlemaniac. [Full review in Spanish]
House of Cards,0,"The final season of House of Cards is too weird and atonal to ignore completely, but it's not good enough to recommend."
Swagger,0,"Every possible sports cliché lands with a thud, the dialogue is clunky and the attempt to frame the story as a rebellion against racism falls flat."
The Act,0,Watch Mommy Dead and Dearest as well as the various interviews with Gypsy Rose Blanchard instead; they'll be a lot more fascinating to watch than The Act.
Limitless,0,"Maybe the show will improve when it kicks into the case-of-the-week format and ramps up the nonsensical effects of this mysterious pill, but I don't have high hopes."
The Queen's Gambit,0,"It is a show that takes itself so seriously that, when former child actor Thomas Brodie-Sangster turns up dressed like an escapee from the Wild West, you don't know whether it's meant to be funny or not"
Invincible,0,"But both the jokes and the character beats that fuel Invincible are too sporadic to make the series feel anything more than sputtering. Unassailable, it is not."
The Mist,0,"Okay, it's possible I'm overreacting here just a smidge. But Spike's version of The Mist is one dumb piece of work."
Limitless,0,"It's not heavy-handed and it doesn't dumb down its audience (although you do have to buy into the NZT brainpower stuff), it just feels like it's missing something, and I think that something may be a level of investment in the characters."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"While the strong ensemble cast made for a promising set-up, the series was besmirched by an increasingly infuriating script and a trite ending that had this viewer hurling decaying vegetables at the screen."
Slow Horses,0,This spy thriller hitches its wagon to an insufferable performance.
Mr. Corman,0,"It's not dark enough or funny enough, or meaningful enough or irreverent enough."
The Stand,0,"For those who enjoyed the original inclined to ask, ""Why do I need this?,"" the answer is pretty well ""You don't,"" other than a promised new coda to the story written by King."
Mr. Corman,0,Even the presence of Debra Winger as Josh's mom... and Juno Temple as his ex (a character who feels too ill-defined to really work) feel like wasted opportunities.
Big Little Lies,0,"I admire restraint, and I can appreciate a destabilizing ending. But in season two, it felt as if Big Little Lies was missing whole pieces of narrative cohesion."
Community,0,it's hard to shake the feeling that Community's continued existence has taken precedence over purpose. It's an overall diminishment that isn't helped by the shrinking cast.
The Fall,0,"For all its psychological, almost literary complexity, it loses much of its narrative steam. It's that great 21st-century phenomenon: a show that's more fun to think about than it is to watch."
Safe,0,Safe isn't without its ticking clock grittiness and compelling riddles but there's also unintended comedy involved with a story where everyone somehow unwittingly contributes to someone's dire demise.
Prison Break,0,The not-so-good news about Prison Break is that the suspension of disbelief it requires is simply a bridge too far.
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,Iron Fist's sophomore season isn't able to right the many wrongs from its first. Don't waste your time on this one.
House of Cards,0,"With or without Kevin Spacey, it's possible that House of Cards had simply run its course. It's just a shame that it couldn't make one final sprint toward the finish line."
The Afterparty,0,"If you're a fan of Haddish or anyone else involved, I'd recommend you look for your yuks elsewhere. Billed as a genre-defying murder mystery, the only thing this tone-deaf pastiche-fest defies is a reason to be seen."
Shameless,0,"I understand that Shameless continues to find Frank useful, but the results are never actually interesting, nor do they ever add up to anything."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"Fox's delusions grow to the point where it's sometimes hard to believe what's happening, and it makes less of a statement about consumerism and the dangers of a free market than it, as I said already, does the Walter White thing in a misfired manner"
The End of the F...ing World,0,Totally disappointing. [Full review in Spanish]
The Thing About Pam,0,"While providing superficial nods to Pam’s grievances, The Thing About Pam repeatedly recedes into a one-note character study, a regression only emphasized by Renée Zellweger’s exaggerated lead performance."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Despite able performers and potent themes, the show is so addicted to chaos that it squanders its chance to say anything substantive."
Ozark,0,All of this generates incident. But little has the heat of real drama.
The Nevers,0,"The Nevers is a huge mess, which has both far too much going on yet is also crushingly stupefying. The only bright points were Donnelly and Skelly, who shared an irascible chemistry."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,The story fails to convince that the couple shares much more than an understanding of the obstacles keeping them apart. So much time is spent on establishing the rules of this show’s game that there’s little room to play.
The Nevers,0,"A mess it is, which is a shame, because of all the too-much going on, a lot of it is a lot of fun."
Joe vs Carole,0,"It's called Joe vs. Carole, but it should have been called Dumb vs Dumber."
Starstruck,0,"The reason why romantic comedies never have sequels is because either everything is going well with the couple and there’s nothing to watch. Or, there is conflict and the original love story is ruined. Starstruck’s second season suffers from the latter."
The Essex Serpent,0,"The pacing is slow, and rather than feeling meditative or breathable, The Essex Serpent only feels mechanical, ploddingly carrying the plot forward scene to scene. Whatever electricity the leads’ performances could have lent it is thoroughly deadened."
WandaVision,0,It's like plugging through porridge for the chocolate button at the bottom of every bowl.
The Crown,0,The show seriously falters with Diana... The Crown prides itself on verisimilitude and that starts to fall away in Season 4.
Westworld,0,"Viewers who have come this far might not be able to resist sticking around for answers, but these are all teasers the show is posing about itself, from within its own impenetrable lore. Those big questions have shrunk from view."
The Afterparty,0,"If you're a fan of Haddish or anyone else involved, I'd recommend you look for your yuks elsewhere. Billed as a genre-defying murder mystery, the only thing this tone-deaf pastiche-fest defies is a reason to be seen."
The Fall,0,"For all its psychological, almost literary complexity, it loses much of its narrative steam. It's that great 21st-century phenomenon: a show that's more fun to think about than it is to watch."
The Wheel of Time,0,"With a deficit of whimsy and wonder, ""Wheel"" introduces such thinly developed characters that it makes it hard to care (or see) who survives a chaotically filmed attack by monstrous orcs (sorry, trollocs)."
The Nevers,0,"A generous take on The Nevers is that it's a fin de siècle X-Men, or maybe a Victorian Watchmen. A less generous take is that it's a more expensive version of Fox's The Gifted, one made without any clear understanding of hour-long cable narrative rhythm."
Gaslit,0,"The entire time I watched Gaslit, I ricocheted between thinking it was a thought-provoking series full of memorable performances and that it was a terrible series that too frequently felt like a Saturday Night Live skit."
Prison Break,0,"More than a new installment of Prison Break, this season feels a bit like Homeland For Dummies, with the political intrigue and intelligence-community backstabbing brought down to a grade-school level."
Shadow and Bone,0,"More exhausting than thrilling, Netflix's latest period fantasy adventure, ""Shadow and Bone,"" will have a tough time breaking out of the fan base already built by the books."
Mare of Easttown,0,"It's nice that HBO has turned out another handsomely produced, manifestly serious mini-series for the wonderful actress Kate Winslet. It would be nicer if those series were worth her time and talent."
Big Little Lies,0,"The new episodes flirted with exploring the effects of trauma, but the writers shrugged when it came to finding a deeper meaning to suffering than that it simply sucks."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,0,The series starts strong but its main character only grows thinner as the story progresses.
The Stand,0,"Sadly there is very seldom any notion of stakes, of consequence, or of danger in this ultimately lifeless adaptation."
Invasion,0,"Rather than so much as utter the word ""alien"" in these initial episodes, Invasion focuses on the global ripple effects of increasing panic -- which might be fine, if it also did a decent job developing its many characters along the way."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Iron Fist Season 2 marks an improvement over its well-derided freshman run, but still lacks punch."
X-Men,0,Frankly - and it pains me to say this - it would be better if the final season of X-Men: The Animated Series didn't exist at all.
House of Cards,0,"In the moments when Claire is allowed not just the camera but the story, ""House of Cards"" is a ride; when the past is relitigated and the specter of Frank rears up once more, it feels like that worst thing a binge-able drama can be: a trudge."
Castle Rock,0,"I can't tell if the new season is over-reaching, under-reaching or if the Annie Wilkes of it all is just overshadowing the story to an unanticipated degree."
Black Mirror,0,"The fifth series of Black Mirror is comprised of episodes that feel less like the work of Brooker and more like thin, wanting knock-offs that were inspired by him."
Taboo,0,"This tale sometimes feels like what might have happened if Sweeney Todd went after the East India Company, but it's weighed down by less-than-thrilling characterization."
The First,0,"The show has a bland, sanitized feel, no matter how hard its cheesy score tries to heighten the inspiration at every turn. The best sci-fi stories, underneath the robots and space flights, are great human stories."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Maybe it'll tie together in the final two episodes and reach a dramatically satisfying conclusion with a few nifty turns and twists down the stretch. So far, though, this is a perfectly mediocre affair."
WeCrashed,0,
Game of Thrones,0,"[This season] made choices that I just didn't understand...you have to wrap it up somehow, and this season is just full of more extremes and it just doesn't work anymore or fit in with the rest..."
Killing Eve,0,"Fourth time around, the sense is of having spent too long on a carnival ride. Nausea is kicking in."
Treadstone,0,"As spy dramas go, this one is better left out in the cold."
Westworld,0,"Will it all come together in a way that’s narratively sensible and emotionally satisfying? Fool me thrice, shame on me. Fool me four times, shame on Westworld."
Marvel's Agent Carter,0,It became... nothing more than a Hayley Atwell vehicle that let everything else from production value to narrative importance fall to the wayside if it meant the show's lead actress getting in just one extra spunky line of dialogue.
Tokyo Vice,0,"An exercise in lost momentum, a glimpse at a fading underworld loath to offer any perspective on it. Maybe the wildcat was just a tabby the whole time."
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,Perhaps the worst offender yet of the Netflix/Marvel drama approach of filling up a 13-episode bag with only three or four episodes' worth of story at best.
Game of Thrones,0,"Game of Thrones finally finished, the last episode aptly titled The Long Night and it was a terrible ending, disappointing for fans, causing a collective cringe around the globe."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,We could've developed Bucky loads more.
And Just Like That...,0,"The name surely carries plenty of equity, but like the movies, this HBO Max show yields diminishing returns."
Snowflake Mountain,0,A bunch of supposed adults complaining about having to take a dump in a latrine.
Pieces of Her,0,"The bad news is that most of the other elements are merely fine, such that there’s no great takeaway for viewers beyond “wow, Toni Collette!” and even that, repeated ad nauseam, becomes a kind of quiet damnation of everything else."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"I had the same uneasy reaction to the podcast itself, and I bailed on Shrink early, in both incarnations. But hey, there's obviously an audience for this."
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"This update brings the star power of Jessica Chastain and Oscar Isaac, but can't match the emotional intensity of the original."
Bel-Air,0,"Suck all the joy, exuberance and wondrous charisma out of “The Fresh Prince” — a worthy launchpad for an actor who, in his prime, was widely considered the biggest movie star in the world — and you’re left with the gloomy and plodding “Bel-Air.”"
The Affair,0,The Affair Season 5 Episode 1 was a colossal waste of time.
Moon Knight,0,"The rickety action sequences, paired with questionable CGI, drippy horror, terrible jokes, a shoddily assembled mystery and one too many rounds of over-the-top violence combine to make Moon Knight an unfortunate dud on the Marvel roster."
13 Reasons Why,0,The empathy of the first season has vanished completely. [Full Review in Spanish]
Moon Knight,0,"...audiences that are looking for a unique and dynamic approach to one of the more unorthodox heroes in Marvels repertoire, Moon Knight is a disappointment."
Mr. Corman,0,"Mr. Corman is billed as a ""comedy,"" somehow, but it's missing the laughs. It seems to be going for cringe comedy, but we just end up cringing. I felt more sad watching it than anything."
Invincible,0,"Once the initial face-punch of that first episode wears off, there's not enough powering (or superpowering) ""Invincible."""
Normal People,0,"Their love story is sweet, with many truthful moments of beauty and heartache... But despite the long timespan of the series' events, the characters' emotional arcs move at a much slower pace and become lost in the minutiae."
The Mosquito Coast,0,Even [Justin Theroux's] absorbing performance can't make Mosquito Coast make sense.
Y: The Last Man,0,"Unfortunately, this series doesn't do enough to modernize questions from the original text."
Halo,0,"The derivative touches can't help but make the whole exercise feel generic, exhibiting a lot of hardware but not much creative spark."
Mare of Easttown,0,"Gone are the days when HBO would produce only outright classics targeted at discerning audiences - in the streaming age, a wider clientele must be catered to."
Lisey's Story,0,"Acknowledging its prettiness and production values, and some excellent performances, I found it better than unbearable but something less than beautiful."
Entourage,0,"Entourage feels awfully washed-out and washed-up, kind of like Vince Chase's dormant career, as the show counts down to the end."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"If you are one of the approximately six people who didn't groan at the first season of this plodding, dull headache of a property, good news: You will also not hate the second one."
The White Lotus,0,"The trollish timing of the show's premise, that vacations are wasted on those who least need it, certainly deserves some grudging admiration. But a swerve late in the series disappointingly sails the story toward calmer waters."
Entourage,0,We shall see if the boys become men by the end of this eight-episode season. But I doubt it; they're talking movies now.
Lisey's Story,0,"Apple's Stephen King Miniseries Starts Off Strong, Only to Quickly Fall Apart."
Bodyguard,0,Bodyguard adds to a long and damaging media trend of depicting brown people as terrorists.
Taboo,0,"Taboo is not so much a show as it is an ordeal, a slog through a miasma of squalid period clichés that's possibly even less inviting than last season's FX vanity production, The Bastard Executioner."
Prison Break,0,This was most definitely not the way I wanted nor expected season five to get underway. But here's hoping somehow the show is able to catch its footing because Ogygia was a complete and utter letdown.
Big Little Lies,0,"But by the end of season two of Big Little Lies, I not only didn't fully get what I wanted from it, I didn't feel like I got what I needed, either."
The Mandalorian,0,"Where some will be down for the expansion of this story into the larger connected universe, plenty will morn the loss of what was the most unique piece of the on-screen Star Wars universe to date."
A Teacher,0,It takes its sweet time getting anywhere and it's not an engaging trip. Both Ms. Mara and Mr. Robinson create characters who are sympathetic but also uninteresting; neither provides a reason to hang on.
The Haunting of Hill House,0,The virtuosity in the style is evident. That's why it's a shame that [director and writer Mike] Flanagan neglects elementary aspects like the performances and the script. [Full review in Spanish]
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"Overall The Time Travelers Wife is funny and poignant in its best moments, but uncomfortable and cringe-worthy at its worst."
The Stranger,0,"In lieu of a single, compelling premise, its mystery is a web of disparate threads, which not only makes it plot-heavy but prevents any real character development."
Chucky,0,There's only one vaguely interesting formula tweak here and it's Mancini's decision to make his protagonist queer and then to handle it with a refreshingly casual sensitivity.
Snowflake Mountain,0,"It’s hard to determine how much of Solomon’s “personality” is genuine, but at least he provides some much-needed drama in this largely lacklustre series, which starts out so promisingly but soon peters out faster than a Gen Z doing the dishes."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"There is something algorithmic, machine-made about the series, as if all involved were assembled by a computer trying to simulate buzz-worthy television. Come to think of it, that might make a more interesting series."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"There is too much time to fill, too many episodes to stretch a fairly thin plot across, and too many goddamn strangers to stay interested in any one of them."
The Nevers,0,As creaky as these first four episodes are - reams of exposition alternating between soap-opera twists and cutesy inventions like Penance's li'l electric car - I want to believe there are glimmers of promise.
Inventing Anna,0,This bloated true-crime drama from Shonda Rhimes alternately seeks to scold and celebrate New York con artist Anna Delvey (Julia Garner) and the relentless reporter (Anna Chlumsky) who brought her story to light.
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,0,"The Bad Batch is good to dip into, but it can make for a bad binge."
And Just Like That...,0,"If the iconic image of ""Sex and the City"" is its central quartet striding down a Manhattan sidewalk, this is a series on its back heels: defensive, reactive, terrified to offend."
A Teacher,0,"Mara and Robinson really are excellent, and the series has unsettling atmosphere to spare. But outside of some specific moments in its second half, A Teacher feels as superficial and generic as its title."
Safe,0,It's a thriller by numbers that doesn't feel clever enough for its talented cast.
Godless,0,"Jeff Daniels and Michelle Dockery seeking new sorts of roles is admirable, but the results need a bit of tweaking."
The O.C.,0,A show that had so much juice seems to be running dry.
Bodyguard,0,"After a few chapters, Bodyguard does something that is as bold as it is absurd, changing all the pieces of the game, but losing all cohesion. [Full review in Spanish]"
The Nevers,0,"The world-building, at least, is extensive, and it's possible later episodes might benefit from having carved out so much narrative real estate, so many competing interests. But these early episodes are crowded."
Monsters at Work,0,"As someone who loves the films, I wonder ... do we need more of it? The films are so well self-contained. This feels like an excess of something we don't really need."""
Boardwalk Empire,0,"For its final season, the show seems to want to bring the focus back onto Nucky, but as usual there's no particularly compelling reason to care about what happens to him."
House of Cards,0,"By the time the last three episodes roll around, House of Cards' final season has abruptly buried itself in a whole host of weird, borderline anti-feminist tropes."
Big Little Lies,0,"The new episodes flirted with exploring the effects of trauma, but the writers shrugged when it came to finding a deeper meaning to suffering than that it simply sucks."
Sharp Objects,0,"It has everything to be a hit, but Sharp Objects does not captivate. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,It's not only that Kelley has gussied up the average Californian spa menu in such a way that everything seems silly rather than satirical. The more he lays on the mysteries and the secrets... the less compelling it all feels.
The Essex Serpent,0,"Despite its riveting source material, The Essex Serpent ends up being a gothic bore. Even the charms of Tom Hiddleston can't save this one."
Little Voice,0,"Yes, those who love musical performances, New York, and the work of Sara Bareilles will likely find a lot to enjoy here, but overall Little Voice is mostly as a disappointment."
Minx,0,It feels like a real missed opportunity that “Minx” is so unwilling to question its own assumptions: that porn is good; that feminism must be fun; and that capturing the White female moneyed gaze is the ultimate marker of the magazine’s success.
The Morning Show,0,"There are too many people on this show, and without exactly being sure what the series' point is, there's no way for the writers to know who to focus on. But I just know it shouldn't be the men."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Nine Perfect Strangers, in contrast to the strengths and limitations of [White] Lotus, tastes bland and feels tonally indistinct."
The Beatles: Get Back,0,"Is it incredible and fascinating to witness the footage in Peter Jackson's ""The Beatles: Get Back"" doc-series? Hell, yes. Is it fascinating to watch the unfocused, directionless 6-hour-plus version of this meandering documentary? Not, really."
House of Cards,0,I doubt that I was the only one whose own lethargy gave her cause for revulsion.
The Essex Serpent,0,[The greater concepts] are squandered for the mundane banality of the people in this town.
Entourage,0,"Entourage feels awfully washed-out and washed-up, kind of like Vince Chase's dormant career, as the show counts down to the end."
Suspicion,0,There’s not enough substance or character development here to hold our attention beyond the time it takes to click “NEXT.”
Halo,0,I dont see much in these early episodes to make investing in a full season worthwhile. Halo does not come remotely close to any of the other sci-fi or fantasy series out there and represents yet another mediocre video game adaptation.
The First Lady,0,The First Lady could have been great.
Brave New World,0,"It spends so much time reveling in its own aesthetic that dramatic momentum becomes an afterthought. At the same time, there are real ideas contained within the nine-part series. Some of them are actually in the book."
The Undoing,0,"The issue isn't that The Undoing tries to channel Big Little Lies, but that it does so unsuccessfully. Even in its failures, however, The Undoing made me dream of a world where TV could crack the code..."
Arrested Development,0,"The more you know about what's happened with Tambor over the past 12 months and the cast's attempt to reframe it, the emptier the comedy's absurdist spectacle becomes."
Suspicion,0,"Aside from a finale that feels notable only for its sloppiness, this thriller is about as forgettable as they come."
Big Little Lies,0,"I admire restraint, and I can appreciate a destabilizing ending. But in season two, it felt as if Big Little Lies was missing whole pieces of narrative cohesion."
Suspicion,0,"By the time you reach the series end, the genre pleasures and the politics have gotten so tangled together and muddled that its hard to care either what happens to the characters, or what the series is trying to say."
The Haunting of Hill House,0,The virtuosity in the style is evident. That's why it's a shame that [director and writer Mike] Flanagan neglects elementary aspects like the performances and the script. [Full review in Spanish]
Brave New World,0,"[Brave New World] could have gone in any wild direction it wanted, but it opted for a take that feels like the safest possible outcome."
The Boondocks,0,The Boondocks is wrapping up its run by being more like Al Pacino as Al Pacino in Jack and Jill: a sad-looking shell of itself that sometimes recaptures its past spark but has seen better days.
Godless,0,"Jeff Daniels and Michelle Dockery seeking new sorts of roles is admirable, but the results need a bit of tweaking."
Arrested Development,0,"The meandering plot sucks the charm from everything. The characters feel oddly as though they don't get to exhibit or develop the traits we know them by, as they're usually too busy rattling off exposition."
Behind Her Eyes,0,"Behind Her Eyes just doesn't know what it wants to be and takes itself far too seriously, resulting in a muddled mess that could - and should - have been cut short."
Looking for Alaska,0,"Though its cast is immensely likable and more than up to the task at hand, this limited series never manages to fill the characters or its narrative with enough emotional depth to accomplish what it's trying to."
The First Lady,0,"Ten episodes in, you don’t come away feeling you know the stories of these women any better, any deeper, than you already did."
Lovecraft Country,0,"The show inadvertently simplifies the realities of white supremacy with its monster allegory, while treating the Black cast less as characters in their own right and more as vehicles for a sweeping critique of American racism."
X-Men,0,The fifth season isn't worth watching.
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,A story that lacks strength... torn between what it wants to tell and how. [Full review in Spanish]
Behind Her Eyes,0,Where others excel with the dark and twisty storylines building intrigue and frightening sequences this one is only good for mustering up a sleepy yawn.
Star Trek,0,"The actors seem tired, bored in most scenes. Even [William] Shatner, which is saying something."
How I Met Your Mother,0,"In spite of a couple of lovely moments, the ""HIMYM"" finale was a terrible miscalculation."
Succession,0,"Succession is often very funny, and always extremely bleak. But the show's window-dressing doesn't deliver the same vicarious thrill anymore."
Lost,0,Like the televisual equivalent of a keyboard-pounding poet... At least we know that we'll only have to suffer through one more season of this foolishness.
The Nevers,0,"It feels empty, as if the scripts are just going through the motions; the characters have so little substance beyond their spunky quips that the dramatic moments, when they inevitably arrive, ooze into each episode like treacle."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"I can only speak for myself, but I don't have the patience for this anymore. At least Breaking Bad had the decency to make Walter White a tame family man before he went gonzo."
His Dark Materials,0,"For a story centered on the exploits of a frightened, isolated teenager, the show remains remarkably devoid of any sense of fear, excitement, or passion."
Pieces of Her,0,It just could have been so much better.
Shining Girls,0,"There’s good stuff here: Alongside Moss, Moura as the journalist aiding her, and Jamie Bell as the personification of human venality pursuing her, do fine work. But there’s simply not enough story here to make for a credible eight-episode series."
Pieces of Her,0,Pieces Of Her takes forever to come together.
Vikings: Valhalla,0,"If youre just here to up the historical combat quotient in your screen diet, have at it. But dont expect much else."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"The storylines are byzantine, but they are not complicated. There is also no shortage of weary, heavy-handed platitudes, like fortune cookies that exclusively quote Bob Segar songs."
Invasion,0,"Rather than so much as utter the word ""alien"" in these initial episodes, Invasion focuses on the global ripple effects of increasing panic -- which might be fine, if it also did a decent job developing its many characters along the way."
Bridgerton,0,Bridgerton season 2 is a lackluster season that hopes to recapture the heights of its first but mostly falls short.
24,0,This 24 revival seems motivated by more pragmatic and mercenary considerations: trying to wring a few more nuggets out of a played-out goldmine.
Ramy,0,"When it comes to the politics of Islam, supposedly one of the main focuses of the show, Youssef shies from delving into the growing division between secular and traditional Islam. It's here where the ideology of the show grows even more muddled."
Undone,0,Nuanced dilemmas quickly fade into the background as the series adopts a more straightforward format in its second season.
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,0,Fellowes hints at drama and pulls his punches.
The O.C.,0,"As is perhaps fitting, though, for a show about teenagers and their notoriously short attention spans, the writers found it hard to keep up the momentum and the quality took a dive... It has been clear the show is on its last legs."
Sharp Objects,0,"The lead performance by Amy Adams as troubled reporter Camille Preaker keeps the show mostly watchable, but it's a chore to get through the dead-end subplots and the slow trickle of narrative developments that surround her."
Chernobyl,0,"What makes one kind of false representation-language and accent-more acceptable than another, such as race?"
Castle Rock,0,There's little apparent benefit to how the show's second season foregrounds its interpersonal relationships.
The Fall,0,"As good as Anderson is throughout, her Stella suffers from a Season 3 lack of development -- we learn nothing about her in this new season that we did not know from the previous two."
Teen Wolf,0,"While Stiles is missed in the last batch of episodes, this fun MTV show finds a nice way to say goodbye."
Moon Knight,0,"Moon Knight is a snooze fest. Most of it is about MacGuffins ... and as the hero and villain chase, find, and procure them, the new Marvel series becomes too plot driven. (This also results in obvious and unnecessary exposition.)"
Loki,0,"Loki feels too constrained, too stale, for a story about a wayward god of mischief. Too much exposition bogs down the script."
Amazing Stories,0,"The upside of any anthology series is the possibility that the next installment can completely turn things around with a brand-new tale. Still, if this is the show's best foot forward, it doesn't imply much optimism."
Stranger Things,0,Stranger Things is still Stranger Things. It just now comes with astoundingly thick levels of padding.
Altered Carbon,0,"This season lays hard into the sci-fi and moves away from the stronger narrative ties that would lend the story to its noir roots. While still a cool show hiring dope and diverse actors, I can't help but want more from the show."
All of Us Are Dead,0,"While the diminishing returns of the shows narrative are a disappointment, the moral implications of its wide-ranging smorgasbord of social commentary are bewildering, if not outright alarming."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Little fires will quickly merge into an overwhelming flame, and even though this is the first scene of the series, Hulu's adaptation goes right ahead and burns itself out."
The First,0,"Sluggishly paced and too familiar in its character beats, it's the sort of prestige project that surely looked good on paper but fizzles once exposed to air."
Dr. Brain,0,"Too often Dr. Brain dodges the dark freakiness of its central idea and instead lingers on rote, slow-moving mystery plotting."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Only one person in this fiasco is any good: the ever-brilliant Joshua McGuire, as Chris Clarke, a Downing Street communications chief."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Give me Hugh Laurie doing Agatha Christie, any day, over hysterical tosh like Anatomy of a Scandal."
Chernobyl,0,"That methodological approach gives the HBO Chernobyl series a distinct impression of truthiness despite factual errors, almost all of which were unsubtly designed to make the Soviet government look bad."
13 Reasons Why,0,"Readers may recall how promising this show was at the beginning, when it was simply the adaptation of an acclaimed young adult novel... The final season reclaims only crumbs of that sensibility."
Arrested Development,0,I wanted to laugh like never before. Voice of the narrator Ron Howard: I did not succeed. [Full Review in Spanish]
The Mist,0,"To basically every character in The Mist, allow me to paraphrase the hero of the movie version of a different Stephen King novella: Get busy being better written, or get busy dying."
The Act,0,"It's dull and lacking in creativity, and it's disheartening that what could have been an interesting exploration of factitious disorder imposed on another - and why we're morbidly fascinated by it - became a tawdry, unoriginal series of cheap shots."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"This Iron Fist ain't immortal, he's got a real short shelf life."
Coyote,0,To be blunt: a show that asks its audience to connect to a rogue Border Patrol agent with literal blood on his hands needs to work harder than this one does to justify its premise.
Arrested Development,0,"But resurrecting all of the previous season's complicated plotlines in one episode comes with its own consequences. Check your lease, Netflixers, because you're living in Flashback City."
Loot,0,"The Apple TV+ series has a concept and a star that practically commands you to pay attention, but the show fails to build on its foundation and is an imperfect showcase for Rudolph’s talents."
Roar,0,"In its attempts to universalize these intensely personal experiences, Roar loses much of the heart that makes them worth caring about to begin with."
The Nevers,0,"The Nevers may get better when Whedon is no longer involved. It also may not. As it stands, the show is airing proof that Whedon's former proficiency, which insulated him from experiencing the consequences of his disturbing actions, has vanished."
Lisey's Story,0,"Lisey's Story has a strong cast and direction, but the writing ultimately sinks the series."
Brave New World,0,"It's just never compelling, never engrossing and, worst of all, not thought-provoking to the degree it needs to be given its subject matter and acclaimed, if dated, source material."
The Offer,0,The depictions of real-life actors border on mimicry... The various Mafia personages appear to have watched The Godfather once too often.
Naomi,0,"Moves in slow motion, feeling like a conventional high-school drama with just a pinch of superheroics provided to pull the audience along."
Suspicion,0,"Suspicion raises too many doubts, and fails to resolve any of them."
Foundation,0,"The time jumps are confusing and the story needs a clearer arc. It doesn't feel immersive enough and, absent the texture of everyday life, the stakes feel too theoretical. The editing is clunky and the show lacks a sense of humor."
And Just Like That...,0,"To say I was disappointed with where we ended up is something of an understatement. However, theres a spark of promise in some of these storylines, and if we get Season 2, its possible that the series could improve. Or maybe Im deluded."
Midnight Mass,0,The final scene was so nauseatingly mawkish I had to hide behind the sofa screaming to be put out of my misery.
The Stand,0,"Boone and Cavell make a series of choices that not only diminish the awesome terror of the first part of King's novel, but the characters themselves, their journeys, and any reason we should care about them."
And Just Like That...,0,Nothing about the show feels organic; so much about it is painfully forced.
The Mist,0,"Some character depth would help maintain interest for 10 episodes around a scary fog, but from the town's cops to the high school jocks, it all feels like a mediocre horror movie. That's a hard sell for 10 weeks."
Guilty Party,0,"It's clear that Guilty Party has set out to spin a narrative about a complicated woman working a complicated case. But at this point in the story, the whole thing seems on the verge of buckling under one complication too many."
The Righteous Gemstones,0,"Season two of ""The Righteous Gemstones"" is an ambitious, intermittently hysterical mess. McBride and Hill attempt to expand the show outward, often into full-on action set pieces that, while impressive, fail to find cohesion with the rest of the series."
WeCrashed,0,
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"The best part about 9 Perfect Strangers is that the Wikipedia entry states up top ""not to be confused with Perfect Strangers."" Oh, how I wish that this were the tale of 9 Balkis..."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,Its timely racially and politically charged plot lacks focus.
Prison Break,0,The not-so-good news about Prison Break is that the suspension of disbelief it requires is simply a bridge too far.
Limitless,0,"With this new series, CBS seems to have squandered the potential of a weird, compelling premise by cramming it into an average procedural crime-show mold."
Pretty Little Liars,0,"In its seventh season, Pretty Little Liars illustrates the dangers of stretching a mystery as far as it can go with a splashy premiere that fails to establish real stakes for its characters."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,It's hard to imagine the viewer who will want to spend much more than the pilot's first hour in Kingstown.
Archive 81,0,Is Archive 81 the silliest show on telly? Probably not -- but it certainly comes close.
The Night Of,0,"Actor/producer James Gandolfini's last project was meant to be a stirring indictment of the criminal justice system. Instead, it plays like an overwrought NYPD Blue episode."
His Dark Materials,0,With so much time taken up with gabbing there was little left for the kind of spectacle that made the first series a hit.
The Wilds,0,"The end result is a season that is overstuffed and yet drags, as though the boys sucked all the energy out of the first season, as they do."
Defending Jacob,0,"The result is a story that feels both overstuffed and underdeveloped. Like its namesake, Defending Jacob is brought down just as it's taking off."
Behind Her Eyes,0,It opts for a bizarre shock that's baffling at best and deeply tone-deaf at its worst.
The Essex Serpent,0,"A decent production budget and starry cast led by Tom Hiddleston and Claire Danes are squandered on a dreary, convoluted, portentous drama with all the appeal of a fog blanket over a giant rotting fish which someone briefly mistook for a dead dragon."
The Nevers,0,The Nevers begins with an intriguing premise and develops it in such a plodding way that interest progressively fades with each successive hour.
Pieces of Her,0,"Well acted and highly suspenseful, the eight-part Netflix thriller “Pieces of Her” never lets up. This is a good thing for the first five episodes. Then it grows exhausting."
And Just Like That...,0,"Ah, well."
Suspicion,0,"Suspicion raises too many doubts, and fails to resolve any of them."
Turner & Hooch,0,"Turner & Hooch could deliver a solid family dramedy or a mindless action-comedy; by trying to be both, the show ends up neither."
Mr. Corman,0,Even the presence of Debra Winger as Josh's mom... and Juno Temple as his ex (a character who feels too ill-defined to really work) feel like wasted opportunities.
Killing Eve,0,"Like a bad romance, Killing Eve is keeping its couple apart without logical or emotional justification. In the process, it’s dulled the spark provided by these two excellent actors as well as the tension sustained by their taste for danger."
Lisey's Story,0,This show is hellbent on driving me mad thanks to one of its biggest stumbling blocks: the absence of any sort of logic to this universe.
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Maybe it'll tie together in the final two episodes and reach a dramatically satisfying conclusion with a few nifty turns and twists down the stretch. So far, though, this is a perfectly mediocre affair."
The Pentaverate,0,"That the resulting show isn’t good doesn’t especially matter, in the end. It’ll probably still find enough curious viewers to justify the partnership, and for Netflix, that’ll be more than enough."
Shadow and Bone,0,"'Shadow and Bone' is trying to show way too much in too little time, leaving its best intentions emotionally stunted and inert."
Hawkeye,0,"Acknowledging that the character is the least-exciting Avenger can be fun in small doses, but it's not a thing to base an entire series on."
Moon Knight,0,Moon Knight attempts to do something even more different in the MCU but it fails at every attempt.
Chernobyl,0,"We should be engaged by the tragic flaws and nobility of all this by this point, but the story and characters have gone so uncorralled that it takes all your viewing energy just to keep it fractionally straight."
Succession,0,"Succession is often very funny, and always extremely bleak. But the show's window-dressing doesn't deliver the same vicarious thrill anymore."
Outer Range,0,"Outer Range isn’t consistently satisfying as a drama series, though as an extended metaphor for television viewing circa 2022, this story of a Wyoming family throwing things in a mysterious hole on their ranch is at least unintentionally savvy."
Altered Carbon,0,"It had good moments, it had bad moments, it had dull moments. I kind of wish now that there was just Season 1 standing alone as a great example of the genre..."
The Wheel of Time,0,"With a deficit of whimsy and wonder, ""Wheel"" introduces such thinly developed characters that it makes it hard to care (or see) who survives a chaotically filmed attack by monstrous orcs (sorry, trollocs)."
The X-Files,0,"The adjustments made for the opening episode show less of the kind of creative skills that made episodes like ""Triangle,"" ""Home"" and ""Ice"" so memorable and come across as a uninspired solution to what looked like an unfixable situation."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"Overall The Time Travelers Wife is funny and poignant in its best moments, but uncomfortable and cringe-worthy at its worst."
Taboo,0,"What it lacks, unfortunately, is Thrones' sweep, moments of playfulness and narrative drive - or any drive at all."
Moon Knight,0,"Flashes of brilliance offer a glimpse of the more introspective, imaginative show we were promised, and the finale has the opportunity to deliver. As it stands, though, Marvel Studios' latest Disney+ outing is also its most disappointing."
Scandal,0,It's unsettling to follow - it doesn't feel like the same Scandal we've grown to love.
Shadow and Bone,0,The storytelling in this adaptation from showrunner Eric Heisserer (Bird Box. Arrival) fails to establish and maintain a momentum nearly as powerful as some of the show's magic.
Sex/Life,0,A show that has no idea what kind of message it wants to send.
The Last Kingdom,0,"Political intrigue and historical authenticity, not to mention decent acting, gave way to romantic slush, [and] unconvincing dialogue which could never make up its mind whether it wanted to be cod-Shakespearean or yoof-friendly."
After Life,0,"Hardcore fans of the show - which are legion - will mourn its passing, but for the rest of us, Gervais's maudlin curio remains a kind of purgatory."
WeCrashed,0,"WeCrashed establishes that shameless hustlers worth billions, even when played by Academy Award winning movie stars, are not necessarily interesting people."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"The only thing shocking about Anatomy of a Scandal is that David E. Kelley, creator of series like Picket Fences, Ally McBeal and The Lawyer, hasn't had a hit since the first season of Big Little Lies. [Full review in Spanish]"
Godless,0,I was excited for it... I think I fell asleep within the first 10 minutes of it. It was so unbelievably boring.
Brave New World,0,"""Antiseptic"" doesn't begin to describe it."
The Essex Serpent,0,This “Serpent” slithers away without leaving much of an impact.
Pieces of Her,0,"The bad news is that most of the other elements are merely fine, such that there’s no great takeaway for viewers beyond “wow, Toni Collette!” and even that, repeated ad nauseam, becomes a kind of quiet damnation of everything else."
Killing Eve,0,"With only eight episodes in the series, it’s time to stop idling and hit the gas pedal. And new characters and errant plot threads only hinder what should be the driving force of the series, namely the Eve and Villanelle relationship."
Losing Alice,0,"Despite the interesting way Alice and Sophie play off each other in the first two episodes, their interactions and the show as a whole has increasingly diminishing returns."
True Blood,0,Headaches will be induced just in trying to unravel the plot mess Bon Temps finds itself in. At least this will be the last headache.
And Just Like That...,0,"If the iconic image of ""Sex and the City"" is its central quartet striding down a Manhattan sidewalk, this is a series on its back heels: defensive, reactive, terrified to offend."
True Blood,0,Headaches will be induced just in trying to unravel the plot mess Bon Temps finds itself in. At least this will be the last headache.
You,0,"For a thriller that was previously known for dealing largely in shock value, Joe's actions - accompanied once again by his over-indulgent inner monologue - now start to wear thin to the point of becoming predictable."
Pachinko,0,"While showrunner Soo Hugh cannot have had an easy task in finding the series within this sprawling, multigenerational novel, and while she conjures moments of immense power, and of connection, throughout, Pachinko does not, finally, cohere."
Little Voice,0,"It can be a little wearing over the seasonal long haul, but it is true in its way to our sentimental experience and why nothing succeeds in working us up, and working us over, quite like a pop song."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"It's a deeply terrifying story of manipulation and abuse that plays like a comedy, sometimes when it doesn't mean to, but isn't all that funny when it's trying to be."
Lisey's Story,0,"Acknowledging its prettiness and production values, and some excellent performances, I found it better than unbearable but something less than beautiful."
And Just Like That...,0,"If the iconic image of ""Sex and the City"" is its central quartet striding down a Manhattan sidewalk, this is a series on its back heels: defensive, reactive, terrified to offend."
The Boondocks,0,The Boondocks is wrapping up its run by being more like Al Pacino as Al Pacino in Jack and Jill: a sad-looking shell of itself that sometimes recaptures its past spark but has seen better days.
The Mosquito Coast,0,"The creative choice to provide little to no backstory severely dulls the show's impact. The Mosquito Coast remains just a surface-level, sepia-toned thriller about a family on the run, mostly to coax the vanity of its patriarch."
We Own This City,0,"The shows talented cast and shocking plot compel, but its dry factual narrative and blind-spot-heavy examination of policing make for an ultimately unsatisfying viewing experience."
Fargo,0,"If all of this sounds like a lot of strands to tie together, it is-but unlike in previous seasons, many of these strands really feel ancillary to the gangland drama that stodgily occupies center stage."
Treadstone,0,"As spy dramas go, this one is better left out in the cold."
Y: The Last Man,0,"Having so many leads dilutes the emotional impact, with the chaos of the unknown acting as a low-level threat that's annoying more than devastating."
Amazing Stories,0,Those tuning in expecting to see the director's light touch and clever manner of engaging our emotions will be disappointed: The show's first installment feels less like a revival than a holdover.
Lisey's Story,0,Lisey's Story is a mess in almost every conceivable way.
Halo,0,The early episodes of Paramount+’s much-delayed new adaptation of the classic video game series miss their target...
The Essex Serpent,0,Some viewers are sure to enjoy its generally slow pacing — and all that breathing the story is allowed to do — but others may find their attention drifting more than once.
Taboo,0,"This is the trouble with the show overall: It's just not clear, even after three episodes, what the fascinating James Keziah Delaney wants."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"May get better on the long run but the ""Big Sky"" twist at the start does not bode well."
Loki,0,"Loki could well improve, now that its arduous task of educating us about multiverses, and glumly explaining Loki to himself, is with any luck behind it. Let's hope so."
The Boys,0,The series’ ideology feels increasingly hollow.
Inventing Anna,0,"Despite its more evocative performances, Inventing Anna demands patience that doesn’t pay off, squandering its promising potential along the way."
Stranger Things,0,Stranger Things is still Stranger Things. It just now comes with astoundingly thick levels of padding.
Gossip Girl,0,"With age comes wisdom? Whoever said that should have passed the memo to the Gossip Girl gang, because after six seasons, they're still as clueless as ever."
The Twilight Zone,0,All over the map... Rod Serling had overworked himself into a state of total burnout from which he would never fully recover.
Big Little Lies,0,"I admire restraint, and I can appreciate a destabilizing ending. But in season two, it felt as if Big Little Lies was missing whole pieces of narrative cohesion."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,0,"However, season seven took this farther than it had to, losing the series' signature comedy and making it feel more like a chore to watch week to week than anything else."
Lost,0,Does this mean all of Lost counts for nothing? It's another question I can't answer.
The Offer,0,The depictions of real-life actors border on mimicry... The various Mafia personages appear to have watched The Godfather once too often.
Lovecraft Country,0,"Pulp horror stories are best consumed in a single, quick encounter, before their limitations of plot and characterization become too obvious to ignore. Lovecraft Country is reduced to one of the walking dead long before its final credits roll."
Outer Range,0,"Outer Range isn’t consistently satisfying as a drama series, though as an extended metaphor for television viewing circa 2022, this story of a Wyoming family throwing things in a mysterious hole on their ranch is at least unintentionally savvy."
The Twilight Zone,0,"For its final episode, The Twilight Zone gives us something it spent most of its time railing against: a happy ending of perfect, selfish bliss."
Suspicion,0,"The cast is appealing, but Thurman lacks energy to the point where she seems almost glazed."
And Just Like That...,0,"Nearly a quarter of a century later, And Just Like That affirms that Carrie, Charlotte and Miranda failed to mature into women any sane person would want to spend time with, let alone to grow up to be."
The Boys,0,"You finish each episode with a nasty taste in your mouth, not helped by the fact that so many of the characters are so ghastly you wish they’d all self-explode and put us out of our misery."
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"I'm sure there's some thought-through reason that would sound good on the page, but in practice it's a bucket of cold water on a story whose purpose is body-temperature intimacy."
Brave New World,0,Brave New World has too many parts out of place to be a success - and stripped out one of the most important parts that would have made it a success.
Arrested Development,0,"Arrested Development, which was once, easily, one of my favorite comedies of all time, has become a reanimated corpse that I'd like to see dead and buried."
The Book of Boba Fett,0,The Book of Boba Fett was a series of compounding mistakes. Its best feature was to deliver a Mandalorian sequel that could have been a self-contained film.
Lisey's Story,0,"[Director Pablo Larraín] never entirely immerses us in horror or submerge us in grief. It's the opposite, actually. Instead of engrossed, I felt trapped."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"Though the second season attempts to redefine who its title character is and where he fits within this corner of the superhero universe, the end result is both an odd fit and a moot point."
True Detective,0,This season's attempt to bring back the old True Detective magic also feels a bit stale.
The Endgame,0,"Sure its fun to watch Baccarin regard Bathe with the same kind of amused regard an older brother gives to his younger siblings attempts at tackling him, but it gives The Endgame zero sense of stakes."
The X-Files,0,"And if you are not already a fan, there is no good reason to watch Season 11. The opening episode verged on soap opera, bloated with cringey dialogue and breathy conspiracies."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"If you enjoyed season 1 you'll be perfectly happy with this addition, but it doesn't do anything interesting with a character who should feel more relevant to our current political climate."
The Umbrella Academy,0,"Gets off to a great start, but falls apart halfway through. Klaus still gets a fantastic storyline, however fellow fan favorite Five is basically benched while Allison suffers character assassination. Elliot Page's transition is handled respectfully."
Lovecraft Country,0,"Lovecraft Country feels like a missed opportunity to repurpose the racist fear at the heart of Lovecraft's work to articulate the specific dread, isolation, and social death felt by Black people in all corners of the world."
Brave New World,0,"Brave New World is caught in a feedback loop of references, one that only occasionally resonates with a culture in the midst of challenging systems, unseen and otherwise."
The First Lady,0,"With such powerhouse actors on set, its a shame that the series is a jumbled collection of moments that barely glance upon what makes these women so special."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,Anatomy of a Scandal most resembles a soap opera you’d watch in order to have something on in the background. But the ultra-serious subject matter make it an impossible mindless watch.
Our Flag Means Death,0,Our Flag Means Death proves to be too droll for its own good.
Foundation,0,"Lacking wit or self-awareness, Goyer's robot future is every bit as cold as you'd expect from a space adventure that's actually all about algebra."
Cardinal,0,The whole thing was so chilly that it left me craving a show that is the absolute opposite of this in every way: Death in Paradise.
Chernobyl,0,"At its best, the show emphasizes the layered venality of careerist buck-passing and the hopeful denialism of those who will refuse to think the unthinkable; at its worst, it suggests that these are specifically Soviet characteristics. They are not."
Y: The Last Man,0,"It's impossible to say what Y: The Last Man lost or gained from that upheaval, but what's clear is that this vanilla offering of a post-apocalyptic nightmare is no doubt arriving a decade too late."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"With the mothership's leads on a similar quest for a missing boy, Wonderland seems like an exercise in magical redundancy. This looking glass is cracked."
Limitless,0,A good sci-fi flick forced into a generic procedural TV show.
Waco,0,"What Waco needs, and fails to achieve, is a complex, unified theory of Koresh."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"What's frustrating about Little Fires Everywhere is that the discrepancy between the novel and the miniseries implies that A-list actors are all the show has to offer, when what should really shine is Ng's wise, haunting story."
The Night Of,0,"Everyone else, whether in jail, court, or the police station, is a variation on a character portrayed more distinctively in other TV shows."
Tokyo Vice,0,"After that first episode ends, and Mann hands off the show to other directors, an impression starts to build that the best ""Vice'' has to offer is behind it."
Truth Be Told,0,"Unfortunately, Truth Be Told 2 does not grip at the get-go."
Lisey's Story,0,"Despite the involvement of starry names in front of and behind the camera, intriguing fantasy elements and fascinating themes, the show never achieves the resonance it seems to be reaching for"
The Beatles: Get Back,0,"Clearly in an act of self-parody, Jackson has transformed what was initially supposed to be a two-hour film into a three-part series that is nearly four times longer than originally intended."
Twin Peaks,0,"""Twin Peaks"" still has the power to shock at times, but this is largely 217 characters (the number of actors in the new season) in search of an author."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"The cast of Nine Perfect Strangers is too good for the limited series to ever be unwatchable. But after seeing six of eight hour-long episodes, I'm pretty sure the biggest mystery has nothing to do with any of the damaged characters."
Weeds,0,It felt like the Weeds finale could have been more focused and a bit more eventful.
Chloe,0,"It’s not that Chloe is awful... It’s just a bit implausible, and far too slick for its own good."
The Nevers,0,Astonishingly pedestrian.
Twin Peaks,0,"""I am dead. Yet I live,"" [Laura Palmer] said. Much the same could be said of the revival, which resembles a danse macabre, full of familiar steps, but with some new missteps all of its own."
Taboo,0,"Taboo is not so much a show as it is an ordeal, a slog through a miasma of squalid period clichés that's possibly even less inviting than last season's FX vanity production, The Bastard Executioner."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"The show depends to a large degree on our knowing that this crazy thing really did happen, kinda sorta in this way. At the same time, with all such adaptations, it is cramped by that dependency..."
11.22.63,0,No one would figure going back in time to spare the life of JFK would be easy or quick. But does it have to drag on so long and be this tiresome to watch?
The Nevers,0,"The world-building, at least, is extensive, and it's possible later episodes might benefit from having carved out so much narrative real estate, so many competing interests. But these early episodes are crowded."
Lost,0,"It became a show about placating, even sedating, fans, convincing them that, in the absence of anything coherent or challenging, love was enough."
Loki,0,"Loki feels too constrained, too stale, for a story about a wayward god of mischief. Too much exposition bogs down the script."
Invasion,0,"While it's an ambitious, sometimes welcome subversion of the genre, the approach often works to the series' detriment."
Lost,0,Like the televisual equivalent of a keyboard-pounding poet... At least we know that we'll only have to suffer through one more season of this foolishness.
Midnight Mass,0,"They could have just gone so much further with... the mysticism, the miracles, and even the backstories of these characters."
Mare of Easttown,0,"Gone are the days when HBO would produce only outright classics targeted at discerning audiences - in the streaming age, a wider clientele must be catered to."
What If...?,0,"Perhaps Marvel's What If...? will be more accessible to non-discerning younger viewers, but for adults, there is not much here to recommend."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"I'd watch these characters all day under the simplicity of a spotlight and a monologue, free from the pretentious packaging. It's a shame that the show seems to get hit with a tranquilizer dart after the first couple of episodes ..."
Ozark,0,The final episodes were just awful. Everything that kept me from really bonding with the series about a family breaking bad was on display in those last hours.
Weeds,0,"Pour one out to Showtime's Weeds, y'all. But not the good stuff. The show no longer deserves it."
WeCrashed,0,Apple TV's first high-profile letdown doesn't know whether to satirise WeWork founder Adam Neumann or to idolise him.
The Thing About Pam,0,"While providing superficial nods to Pam’s grievances, The Thing About Pam repeatedly recedes into a one-note character study, a regression only emphasized by Renée Zellweger’s exaggerated lead performance."
Taboo,0,"... if you have ever wished to know what you get when too many alpha males gather in a room, perhaps this is it."
Castle Rock,0,There's little apparent benefit to how the show's second season foregrounds its interpersonal relationships.
Rise,0,It's time for a break from the tears. You have to earn those.
Prison Break,0,"More than a new installment of Prison Break, this season feels a bit like Homeland For Dummies, with the political intrigue and intelligence-community backstabbing brought down to a grade-school level."
1883,0,"For fans of westerns, 1883 certainly looks like the real deal, coming from Yellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan and featuring Sam Elliott as a gnarled cowboy. The execution, however, feels stale."
All of Us Are Dead,0,"The series ultimately bites off more than it can chew in themes, characters, and ambition."
Minx,0,It feels like a real missed opportunity that “Minx” is so unwilling to question its own assumptions: that porn is good; that feminism must be fun; and that capturing the White female moneyed gaze is the ultimate marker of the magazine’s success.
Community,0,it's hard to shake the feeling that Community's continued existence has taken precedence over purpose. It's an overall diminishment that isn't helped by the shrinking cast.
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"With the mothership's leads on a similar quest for a missing boy, Wonderland seems like an exercise in magical redundancy. This looking glass is cracked."
The Gilded Age,0,We know who these people are. They're clichés -- not unpleasant but wholly unsurprising.
"Doogie Kamealoha, M.D.",0,"Right now, Doogie Kameāloha, M.D. is a predictable show on many fronts, including its slavish devotion to the original program."
Brave New World,0,There's nothing brave or new to see here.
The Mist,0,"Not nearly enough horror, way too much exposition (in the opener). Even the fog seems a little bored hanging around for something to happen."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Because the cast is so strong, they bring some poignancy to these roles... These are all intriguing personalities. Yet Kelley and his writing and directing team can't find a definitive lens to frame what the story is meant to convey about them."
Cardinal,0,The whole thing was so chilly that it left me craving a show that is the absolute opposite of this in every way: Death in Paradise.
Inventing Anna,0,"The show certainly provides indulgence (if maybe not enough for my taste). Its failure is in the framing of Delvey’s story: It’s depicted as a quasi-feminist, girlboss-adjacent revenge fantasy."
And Just Like That...,0,"A woke pamphlet…electing to preach about how the world works.
[Full review in Spanish]"
The Afterparty,0,"If this is the future of television, pass me the bottle."
Sharp Objects,0,"It has everything to be a hit, but Sharp Objects does not captivate. [Full Review in Spanish]"
13 Reasons Why,0,"Season 4 is a disaster that betrays 13 Reasons Why's characters, its only remaining asset. The show has squandered any goodwill left over by its once-charming cast."
Interrogation,0,The most disappointing aspect of Interrogation may be the writers' reluctance to peddle uncertainty.
The Sopranos,0,One can understand David Chase's desire to have a completely unique ending... But that doesn't mean we have to like it.
The Shrink Next Door,0,Mainly what held my interest in The Shrink Next Door was the myriad reasons it doesn't quite work.
Schmigadoon!,0,"After having borrowed quite so heavily from traditional forms, the show only haltingly and gradually, and without much of the help that the neglected Key and Strong might have provided, arrives at something that can stand on its own."
The X-Files,0,"Once we were charmed by this gloriously imaginative fiction, but with this latest iteration Chris Carter has only managed to weave a tapestry of unparalleled nonsense."
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"The first time it happened, I thought I'd pressed play on a behind-the-scenes special. By the time episode three rolled around, I started shouting 'No!' at the telly."
Amazing Stories,0,"Optimism isn't a bad thing to have on TV shows, but when that's the only thing you've got going for you, living up to ""amazing"" seems like a reach."
Jericho,0,"Well the good news is that the show is kinda-sorta ratcheting up the focus on the ""what happened"" story, plus it's looking more into how the country as a whole is dealing with its post-nukey self. The bad news is, I totally don't care anymore. At all."
Prison Break,0,"As is so often the case, creating buzz worthy content doesn't necessarily translate into content that justifies its existence beyond causing a stir. That's largely how Prison Break feels."
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,0,"The show's attempt to individualize its protagonists largely reduces them to predictable, banal archetypes."
The Offer,0,"While The Offer is an intermittently entertaining fictionalization about the making of the greatest movie of all time, your time would be far better spent re-watching the greatest movie of all time and the greatest sequel ever."
Sex/Life,0,"For a show about the basic instincts, it's unusually removed from anything recognizably human; for a look at what it means to heedlessly seek fulfillment, it's surprisingly sour and mean."
Pieces of Her,0,"Well acted and highly suspenseful, the eight-part Netflix thriller “Pieces of Her” never lets up. This is a good thing for the first five episodes. Then it grows exhausting."
Godless,0,"Godless, with its cinematic longshots of unfettered Western plains, a moody and effective soundtrack, and a phenomenal cast, seemed destined for greatness. But unfortunately, the town of La Belle isn't just lawless - it's also a bit aimless."
And Just Like That...,0,"We recognize these characters, but it's not just someone at the table who's missing - it's an energy."
The Haunting of Hill House,0,This Haunting is so far from the original source material that it's more of a demolition than adaptation.
WandaVision,0,"Based on the first three episodes, 'Wanda Vision' does not deliver the unique entertainment one might expect. However there are indications there may be a brighter future."
Brave New World,0,"""Antiseptic"" doesn't begin to describe it."
Love Life,0,"No matter how much you can appreciate the character's journey, it's not easy for any actor to carry this type of story, but Harper would make you believe otherwise. Here's hoping he gets even better material moving forward."
The Book of Boba Fett,0,"While the series starts strong by leaning on star Temuera Morrison's strong ability and his connection to ingenious storylines, the show ultimately feels more compelled to set up the Star Wars expanded universe then telling a coherent narrative."
Moon Knight,0,"The rickety action sequences, paired with questionable CGI, drippy horror, terrible jokes, a shoddily assembled mystery and one too many rounds of over-the-top violence combine to make Moon Knight an unfortunate dud on the Marvel roster."
Behind Her Eyes,0,"The empty characterization isn't egregious, but it seems like an apparatus that's been built around some hidden central engine the show doesn't want to reveal. Why are these people like this?"
Loki,0,"Loki could well improve, now that its arduous task of educating us about multiverses, and glumly explaining Loki to himself, is with any luck behind it. Let's hope so."
Weeds,0,I'm pretty sure there aren't drugs strong enough to get me to the bittersweet end of this series.
Halo,0,"Schreiber is, indeed, the most interesting thing about Halo -- which isn’t necessarily saying all that much."
And Just Like That...,0,"If the iconic image of ""Sex and the City"" is its central quartet striding down a Manhattan sidewalk, this is a series on its back heels: defensive, reactive, terrified to offend."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"Unless Alice and her rabbit pal have more tricks up their sleeve than Snow White and the gang could muster, ABC's visit to Wonderland might once again leave the network less in need of a looking glass than a rear-view mirror."
Guilty Party,0,"Guilty Party's opening episode presents us with an unbelievable, uncharismatic lead character who seems out of place and ill-equipped for every room she enters."
The Crown,0,"Duty may be life and pain for the royal family. But in The Crown, it's also ultimately spiritless."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,An incredibly frustrating story that never quite brings all of its ideas home.
The Morning Show,0,"""The Morning Show"" has become such a media object of fascination, I think, not just because the odds were so heavily stacked in its favor, but because it ultimately squanders so much of its potential."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"[Mayor of] Kingstown, written by Sheridan, is another muscular soap that's long on characters talking in indecipherable lingo and short on clarity."
The Righteous Gemstones,0,"While fans of the show's first season will likely enjoy the second, its humor too often falls into the habit of reveling in the dumb, gross, and broadly obnoxious."
Brave New World,0,"It spends so much time reveling in its own aesthetic that dramatic momentum becomes an afterthought. At the same time, there are real ideas contained within the nine-part series. Some of them are actually in the book."
Two and a Half Men,0,"I swear to God, I don't think I could come up with a worse ending."
Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey,0,Treating this saga mostly as a shocking play-by-play with a reptilian boogeyman at the center feels a little cheap.
The Stranger,0,"'The Stranger' is an effective and addictive thriller, but despite its overabundance of elements, it is incredibly meaningless. [Full Review in Spanish]"
The OA,0,"The willing suspension of disbelief has to be earned, and from where I'm standing, The OA doesn't earn it."
13 Reasons Why,0,The empathy of the first season has vanished completely. [Full Review in Spanish]
The Shrink Next Door,0,"I had the same uneasy reaction to the podcast itself, and I bailed on Shrink early, in both incarnations. But hey, there's obviously an audience for this."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"Though it began as the one Marvel/Netflix series with the most potential, Jessica Jones has seen its quality dip precipitously with each subsequent season."
The Nevers,0,There are a lot of other shows more worthy of investing your time in.
And Just Like That...,0,"And Just Like That... isn't nearly as clever, funny or as interesting as it thinks it is."
Doctor Who,0,Legend of the Sea Devils was quite disappointing. I appreciated the fresh scenery and all-Asian guest cast but the Sea Devils fell flat mostly due to poor directing taking all the excitement away from their fight scenes.
Altered Carbon,0,"The ideas behind the premise are so good, the potential to examine existential issues about identity and humanity and how they're tied up in our physical form are so great, that it's frustrating to see how often the show takes a too-shallow approach."
Normal People,0,"We were shown banal locations and left to guess what was going on in the characters' minds as they stumbled for words or stared out of windows. That can work in a novel, with its internal monologues, but not on television."
The O.C.,0,A show that had so much juice seems to be running dry.
Godless,0,"Godless is an almighty letdown. The narrative is as expansive as the vast New Mexico plains that form its backdrop, but there's too much creative tumbleweed."
The Staircase,0,"I strongly considered sticking a fork in my eye at least eight times while the footage rolled... and rolled, and rolled, and rolled."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,It's hard to imagine the viewer who will want to spend much more than the pilot's first hour in Kingstown.
X-Men,0,The fifth season isn't worth watching.
13 Reasons Why,0,"Laves nothing to chance, wrapping up almost every major loose end in what is now surely the show's trademark: throw every possible hot button issue into a blender and mash the switch labeled ""the power of friendship and de-escalation"" until smooth."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"Thinking ruins it in a very specific ways. Kick the mental tires too much on this genre romance, and the whole thing slides right into Skeeveyville."
The Beatles: Get Back,0,"Clearly in an act of self-parody, Jackson has transformed what was initially supposed to be a two-hour film into a three-part series that is nearly four times longer than originally intended."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,The true scandal is how lazy it all feels.
The Essex Serpent,0,[The greater concepts] are squandered for the mundane banality of the people in this town.
24,0,Live Another Day feels terribly dated.
The Shrink Next Door,0,"Herschkoph is inherently unlikable, decidedly shifty and lacking in moral fiber, while Markowitz simply misses a backbone. Epiphanies, gumption or redeemable characteristics are in short supply, meaning there is little to get behind as a viewer."
Big Shot,0,"For a show about an ace competitor who finds joy in victory, Big Shot, stacking a canny hero against a universe of people who just don't get it, sure doesn't mind playing unfair."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,This season should have been appropriate titled Iron Fist Season 2: An SJW Redemption Story. AKA: We're sorry we tried to sell you a white dude doing kung fu because clearly only Asians can do that.
Y: The Last Man,0,Y: The Last Man is perfectly serviceable sci-fi fare that won't move the needle too much in either direction in terms of generating controversy or inspiring awe. And that's a shame... That it settles for dull and uninspired breaks my heart.
Twin Peaks,0,"It's hard not to feel like I've been completely, utterly duped. The two-hour kickoff did not repair the damage wrought by Season 2. If anything, it was like taking a sip of damn fine coffee after learning that someone had stuck a fish in the pot."
Inventing Anna,0,"In trying to make the show about gossip and the media, Inventing Anna actually misses whatever it is that Anna herself was up to and rather focused on what she thought she was doing. Instead of adding complexity, it just comes off as muddled."
Fargo,0,"When one character asks a question of another and then announces with a self-regarding smirk that it was rhetorical... Fargo disappears into its own navel, where even the lint is annotated."
Game of Thrones,0,"[This season] made choices that I just didn't understand...you have to wrap it up somehow, and this season is just full of more extremes and it just doesn't work anymore or fit in with the rest..."
The Queen's Gambit,0,A glamorous Anya Taylor-Joy doesn't show the true cost of addiction - but rather a rose-tinted view of womanhood and paint-by-numbers redemption.
The Pentaverate,0,"Underneath its mildly amusing, emotionally scattered exterior, The Pentaverate is a flawed but heartfelt ode to the importance of honesty in an era where lies are widespread and popularized."
The Nevers,0,"This is really unpleasant, and that is all I have."
And Just Like That...,0,"The name surely carries plenty of equity, but like the movies, this HBO Max show yields diminishing returns."
The Nevers,0,"The Nevers doesn't want for narrative, but it feels like Whedon throwing all the Buffy-lite ideas he had together ... and hoping some of it would gel."
Big Shot,0,"The lack of proper development for its teen girls is the most troubling aspect of ""Big Shot,"" all things considered, the element that feels the most performative."
Suspicion,0,"It feels like Suspicion is a bunch of espionage scenes in search of a cohesive story. The story may reveal itself at some point, but right now, the whole operation feels bland and generic."
The Nevers,0,To paraphrase Coco Chanel: This is a TV show that should look in the mirror and take off one plot point before exiting the house.
Roar,0,"Roar has built a daring experiment, bringing in a diverse group of female writing, directing, and acting heavyweights -- which makes the series almost fascinating in its failure to deliver."
Coyote,0,"Breaking Bad director Michelle MacLaren gives this series a ""Bad"" vibe, but that doesn't insure it is good... Coyote proves watchable but too derivative."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,It is a bleak drama series that doesn't seem to bring anything new to the table
Loot,0,"While it has plenty of funny moments, it’s a hard pill to swallow to muster much sympathy for a character that literally has everything she wants."
True Detective,0,"I wondered what I would think if neither of the previous seasons had existed, and I realized-I probably wouldn't be thinking about it at all."
The Thing About Pam,0,"The thing about Pam, sadly, is that despite her crimes, she’s not all that interesting."
Vikings: Valhalla,0,"Valhalla isn’t terrible. But it feels mostly like more of the same, without having much of an identity to itself. In a crowded landscape, that doesn’t give it a lot to fight for."
Weeds,0,It felt like the Weeds finale could have been more focused and a bit more eventful.
Sex/Life,0,"For a show about the basic instincts, it's unusually removed from anything recognizably human; for a look at what it means to heedlessly seek fulfillment, it's surprisingly sour and mean."
The Nevers,0,The Nevers has a lot going for it but it's a distillation of Whedon's best and worst filmmaking impulses. It needs someone with a more disciplined eye to cut half of its many dangling threads and subplots.
Hawkeye,0,"Even a show that approaches its episodic run like an extra-long movie owes the audience a bit more momentum than this, especially when those installments roll out weekly."
The First,0,Packed with corny symbolism and inexplicable cutaways.
Peacemaker,0,"Gunn has given himself and his actors more room to play than he's ever been allotted - eight hours' worth - and hasn't figured out how to fill it with anything but the same labored joke, again and again and again."
And Just Like That...,0,"Far too many 2021 cultural touchstones and new characters are awkwardly parachuted into the luscious looking Michael Patrick King executive produced revival of sorts, as if to check a box."
The Undoing,0,"Like the seemingly perfect lives of its characters, it doesn't hold up under scrutiny."
The Stranger,0,"In lieu of a single, compelling premise, its mystery is a web of disparate threads, which not only makes it plot-heavy but prevents any real character development."
Fringe,0,"At some point, Fringe kind of fell in love with change for its own sake, and it wandered away for long periods from what powered its finest moments - the complex bonds among Olivia, Peter and Walter."
Sex/Life,0,"Having watched all eight episodes of the show, what I remember from it isn't how steamy the sex scenes are (not least because they aren't), but how frustrating I found Billie and all of the people around her."
Big Little Lies,0,"You don't hire a director like Arnold, with a distinct visual style, say that's what you want, and then edit it to be unrecognizable."
Twin Peaks,0,"The original run is one of TV's masterpieces, and Lynch finally returning to this project -- and unshackled by network restrictions -- was great news. In retrospect, limitations might have been welcome since this suffers from extreme excess and overkill."
The Right Stuff,0,The Right Stuff is inoffensively bland.
Lovecraft Country,0,"Rather than be precise in its refutation of the legacy of Lovecraft, Lovecraft Country only takes the broadest possible swipes at the monster of racism, leaving the show feeling oddly one-note and shallow."
Foundation,0,"Lacking wit or self-awareness, Goyer's robot future is every bit as cold as you'd expect from a space adventure that's actually all about algebra."
The Haunting of Hill House,0,This Haunting is so far from the original source material that it's more of a demolition than adaptation.
The Endgame,0,"Morena Baccarin and Ryan Michelle Bathe, longtime supporting players getting starring roles in a large-scale series for the first time, do not feel irreplaceable, and the show's clunky, obvious writing doesn't give them much to work with."
The Undoing,0,"The issue isn't that The Undoing tries to channel Big Little Lies, but that it does so unsuccessfully. Even in its failures, however, The Undoing made me dream of a world where TV could crack the code..."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"The series isn't the surprising horror-esque piece it could be, and it doesn't offer a compelling statement on wellness or the people who buy into it. Nothing really happens at all here."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,It is like I've gone to therapy on a Gwyneth Paltrow GOOP retreat... I feel like I have to go to therapy after suffering through.
Gossip Girl,0,"With age comes wisdom? Whoever said that should have passed the memo to the Gossip Girl gang, because after six seasons, they're still as clueless as ever."
Entourage,0,"Everything that went down on screen in this finale felt rushed, it was almost like no one bothered to tell the writers that they only had eight episodes this season and once they realised they had to squash episodes worth of material in to one half hour."
Big Little Lies,0,"By leaning into exaggeration this season, though, Big Little Lies has made its more sober elements feel like afterthoughts to jokes about the ridiculousness of Californians and self-absorbed stay-at-home moms."
Shining Girls,0,"There’s good stuff here: Alongside Moss, Moura as the journalist aiding her, and Jamie Bell as the personification of human venality pursuing her, do fine work. But there’s simply not enough story here to make for a credible eight-episode series."
The Nevers,0,The Nevers begins with an intriguing premise and develops it in such a plodding way that interest progressively fades with each successive hour.
Shining Girls,0,"Moss is obviously a draw, but even she can only do so much with thin and confusing material."
Vikings: Valhalla,0,"Valhalla isn’t terrible. But it feels mostly like more of the same, without having much of an identity to itself. In a crowded landscape, that doesn’t give it a lot to fight for."
Players,0,Players fell short of the mark for me.
Moon Knight,0,"As much as I enjoyed watching Marc and Steven argue with each other in some Gollumesque fashion, I kept getting lost when the storyline switched from one character to the other."
Turner & Hooch,0,"One difference between the film and the series - and it's a pretty significant one - is that Josh Peck is no Tom Hanks. Another difference - again, pretty significant - is that it's not 1989 anymore."
The Afterparty,0,How does something with such sparky potential come to feel so strangely flat?
Star Trek: Enterprise,0,The most infuriating thing about Enterprise is the fact that it has always had some of the most potential of any of the Trek series and has always gone out of its way to squander every opportunity it has ever had to capitalize on that potential.
The Sopranos,0,"David Chase, after so much brilliant work... seemed to be saying he could take it or leave it. So he left it."
Vigil,0,"According to the end credits, Vigil has been made with support from the Scottish government, which makes no secret of its opposition to nuclear weapons. That may hint at an extra political edge, but doesn't make this a compelling drama."
The End of the F...ing World,0,Totally disappointing. [Full review in Spanish]
Rise,0,Imagine if Glee and Friday Night Lights had a baby and that child overdosed on Lifetime movies.
The First Lady,0,"If ""The First Lady"" gets another season itll need to find a way to create compelling narratives for all its leads and be unafraid to get into the mess that is the White House."
True Detective,0,"It is neither as raw and gripping as the series' rookie season nor as structurally unsound as its second. It is good, not great."
Joe vs Carole,0,"Though it's based on the Wondery podcast that first broke the tawdry tiger tale in 2019, Joe vs. Carole simply doesn't contain enough fresh insight to justify its existence today  despite game performances by the stars."
The Nevers,0,There are a lot of other shows more worthy of investing your time in.
Inventing Anna,0,"If Inventing Anna possesses any relevance at all, its due to the quality of its cast."
Monsters at Work,0,"Monsters At Work will reward long-time fans of this franchise with familiar characters, callbacks, and more time in the intriguing world of Monstropolis. Unfortunately, all it nails about this world is superficial, and not even appropriately rendered."
24,0,"The contemporary anxiety 24 hopes to exploit this time around is of drones and of the increasingly dehumanized nature of warfare, but it has become a sort of dehumanized show, populated by barely human characters."
Waco,0,"Waco has done far more ironing out than enriching in the episodes leading up to next week's grand finale. The Dowdles have hamstrung their own ambitions, reducing Waco from a reckoning with the muddled past to an oversimplification of it."
Reacher,0,"Reacher hits all of the required beats of the story but never does it with a kinda of aplomb. There’s all the elements presented here, but there doesn’t seem to be much in the way of depth and the filmmaking leaves a lot to be desired."
The Morning Show,0,"These cobbled together histrionic dramatics are offensive compared to the gravity of the issues of the first season. Even combined, the desperate scrambles of the second season don't have enough bite, or credibility, for the viewer to invest in."
RENO 911!,0,"Unfortunately, that same sense of nostalgic comfort is also the show's greatest weakness; for better and for worse, the show (and its sense of humor) hasn't changed a whit since it went off the air in 2009."
The Pentaverate,0,"A less-than-stellar return to comedy for Mike Myers, featuring outdated jokes, an attempt at topicality that falls flat, and a waste of talented comedians."
Joe vs Carole,0,"Joe vs. Carole is competently made and entertaining enough but having already sat through the first season of Netflix’s bloated Tiger King, Joe vs. Carole can’t help but feel like a rerun of something I already saw."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"[It] spends a great deal of time drip feeding epiphanies, dwelling in personal moments and dealing in character and yet there is a disconnect. Production design, cinematography and score all come together with direction and tone yet something is missing"
Godless,0,"Godless, with its cinematic longshots of unfettered Western plains, a moody and effective soundtrack, and a phenomenal cast, seemed destined for greatness. But unfortunately, the town of La Belle isn't just lawless - it's also a bit aimless."
The Big Conn,0,"The Big Conn bites off plenty, and occasionally more than it should chew, distending its scope to the point that it loses sight of Conn, whose over-the-top brazenness is the most interesting aspect of this saga."
WandaVision,0,WandaVision doesn't grasp gender or racial representation as well as it thinks it does.
The Offer,0,"The Offer certainly didnt have Coppolas blessing, and I hope this wasnt the reason behind his problematic portrayalhe is shown not as an angsty New Hollywood artist, but as a comedic buffoon."
The Mist,0,There's room for interesting rehashes that bring new perspectives and ideas. The Mist is definitely not one of them.One adaptation was enough.
Big Shot,0,"For a show about an ace competitor who finds joy in victory, Big Shot, stacking a canny hero against a universe of people who just don't get it, sure doesn't mind playing unfair."
The Big Bang Theory,0,"As The Big Bang Theory enters its final season, and these characters enter new phases of their lives, there are so many possible stories to tell. It just has to stop telling all the same ones."
The First Lady,0,"With such powerhouse actors on set, its a shame that the series is a jumbled collection of moments that barely glance upon what makes these women so special."
Defending Jacob,0,"For a show so devoted to stringing you along for answers, ""Defending Jacob"" doesn't leave you with much once it's over."
Brave New World,0,"Despite some evocative (and provocative) visuals and appropriate dramatic tension, it fails to truly excite."
Loot,0,"The Apple TV+ series has a concept and a star that practically commands you to pay attention, but the show fails to build on its foundation and is an imperfect showcase for Rudolph’s talents."
Stranger Things,0,"The whole experience felt like being forced to eat every menu item from the Cheesecake Factory over the course of a day: lots of deliciousness, some things you never wanted, and the whole experience leaving you feeling nothing but bloated."
Fear the Walking Dead,0,"Colman Domingo was as good as always, but all the exposition dumps and plot holes really dragged the [premiere] down, blunting what could have -- in more adept hands -- been a strong opener for Season Seven."
The X-Files,0,"If only Fox would do us a favor and stop bringing this one back. Fans get their hopes up, only to see them crushed again."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,You won't be missing much if you give this season a skip.
Halo,0,"iHaloi looks a lot like well you might expect an adaptation of the game would, but it fails to distinguish itself from similar sci-fi fare."
Big Shot,0,"If you're over ten years old, you've seen everything here before."
The Mosquito Coast,0,The tone-deaf tourism of The Mosquito Coast makes for an adventure that's increasingly difficult to go along with.
True Detective,0,"It is neither as raw and gripping as the series' rookie season nor as structurally unsound as its second. It is good, not great."
The Mist,0,"The series... plays around with elements familiar to members of King's devoted fan base, as well as those from Frank Darabont's intense and somber 2007 feature film of the same name, but with less successful results."
Weeds,0,Almost completely misses.
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,An incredibly frustrating story that never quite brings all of its ideas home.
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"If you are one of the approximately six people who didn't groan at the first season of this plodding, dull headache of a property, good news: You will also not hate the second one."
Invasion,0,Invasion proceeds so incrementally across such a wide range of characters and their responses to extraterrestrial terrorism that you might well lose your way from week to week. Never mind your interest.
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,It's not only that Kelley has gussied up the average Californian spa menu in such a way that everything seems silly rather than satirical. The more he lays on the mysteries and the secrets... the less compelling it all feels.
Legion,0,"I responded to moments of Legion because I vibed with its project, but all of the aspects of that project ended up working better in other shows."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"The best part about 9 Perfect Strangers is that the Wikipedia entry states up top ""not to be confused with Perfect Strangers."" Oh, how I wish that this were the tale of 9 Balkis..."
Stranger Things,0,This volume of the Stranger Things saga could use some of the humor and warmth that made the show such a clever blend of nostalgia and fantasy.
Deadwood,0,It's like saddling up and putting the spurs to a drunk Shetland pony.
Halo,0,"The goal shouldn’t be about being everything to everyone, and while “Halo” treats the source material with respect, it does so with a tentativeness, as if it is afraid to miss a key element."
Suspicion,0,"Suspicion raises too many doubts, and fails to resolve any of them."
Fringe,0,"At some point, Fringe kind of fell in love with change for its own sake, and it wandered away for long periods from what powered its finest moments - the complex bonds among Olivia, Peter and Walter."
The Twilight Zone,0,"For its final episode, The Twilight Zone gives us something it spent most of its time railing against: a happy ending of perfect, selfish bliss."
Godless,0,"Godless is so swept up in the romance of the West that it shortchanges practically everything else -- character, context, story."
Brave New World,0,"Miniseries that scratches on Aldous Huxley's novel, staying on the surface. [Full review in Spanish]"
And Just Like That...,0,"I won't lie - at some level, it's nice to catch up with them. But it lacks the spark of Sex and the City. Now it's just another show."
A Teacher,0,"That economy is one noticeable thing about ""A Teacher."" More noticeable is how seldom it feels like a cautionary tale, despite the onscreen cautions and referrals to sexual assault resources and the story's occasional explicit references."
Girls,0,Girls overreached. There just aren't six seasons worth of interesting material for the average millennial girl to live through without bringing in sensational elements that go above and beyond an average reality.
The Mosquito Coast,0,"The most prescient thing this version of The Mosquito Coast has to say about capitalism is how quickly it morphs into a knockoff of Breaking Bad and Ozark, repackaging a primetime TV template to bring an old story to a new audience."
The Umbrella Academy,0,"This is the most apocalyptic-y apocalypse ever, but it carries no real weight. Then when you find out what has to be done to save the universe, it just feels very underwhelming. Samurais, really?"
Inventing Anna,0,"Inventing Anna is a meandering and shallow take on Anna Sorokin's story, glacially paced with superfluous tangents that distract from the character we're really interested in."
WeCrashed,0,"In declining to conjecture what WeWork’s nosedive meant for the rest of us, it’s got even less of a purpose than a co-working space during a pandemic."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,We could've developed Bucky loads more.
Taboo,0,"Not even often-stunning performances... can dig Taboo out of its messy, overwrought darkness."
Coyote,0,"""Coyote"" may find its way to more substance if it's allowed to prowl a bit longer, but like Ben's bowel movements, you're just as likely to be relieved that it's over."
The Endgame,0,"Morena Baccarin and Ryan Michelle Bathe, longtime supporting players getting starring roles in a large-scale series for the first time, do not feel irreplaceable, and the show's clunky, obvious writing doesn't give them much to work with."
The First Lady,0,"Watching the series attempt to make sense of itself, it’s tempting to believe that it began as three separate Michelle, Betty, and Eleanor shows before The First Lady slapped them together into one."
The Old Man,0,"The Old Man hits all the beats of a standard spy thriller and delivers some bone-crunching action, but the personal stuff falls flat. It strikes a meditative tone, without giving us much to meditate on."
A Wilderness of Error,0,"Morris is asking us to consider an unlikely and generally unheralded possibility, and doing so in a manner so insistent as to make the proposition less and less appealing."
Sharp Objects,0,Sharp Objects scratches the surface of being interesting but can't overcome its dull edges.
The Shrink Next Door,0,"The Shrink Next Door has plenty of star power but can't get past its confused narrative, disappointing lack of character development, and dragging pace."
Lovecraft Country,0,"Rather than be precise in its refutation of the legacy of Lovecraft, Lovecraft Country only takes the broadest possible swipes at the monster of racism, leaving the show feeling oddly one-note and shallow."
Mr. Corman,0,Even the presence of Debra Winger as Josh's mom... and Juno Temple as his ex (a character who feels too ill-defined to really work) feel like wasted opportunities.
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"""Mayor of Kingstown"" appears tailor-made to be forever confused with 100 other shows like it, shackled and forgotten in its allegiance to an outdated template."
The Right Stuff,0,"There's not a lot of wonder or enthusiasm to this version of The Right Stuff, which mostly treats the space program as a grim endurance test."
The Boys,0,The series’ ideology feels increasingly hollow.
House of Cards,0,"In the moments when Claire is allowed not just the camera but the story, ""House of Cards"" is a ride; when the past is relitigated and the specter of Frank rears up once more, it feels like that worst thing a binge-able drama can be: a trudge."
Friends,0,"Even the kiss that cemented Ross and Rachel couldn't disguise the show's larger anti-climax, a cop-out from the logical conclusions of the show's premise, conclusions it began to acknowledge only to ultimately deny their existence."
The Nevers,0,This weird mix of space and steampunk will confuse viewers rather than confound them.
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,Light on romantic chemistry and heavy on the cringe.
The Twilight Zone,0,"Technophobic and misogynistic... you're better than this, Twilight Zone."
Godless,0,"There are interesting ideas and some refreshing roles here, languorously trailed among the endless vistas. But these ideas flare and subside in the slow sprawl of the show, without the assurance of a guiding hand."
Turner & Hooch,0,"It's not very good, but I guess that means it's paying homage to the original."
Invasion,0,"Invasion doesn't appear to be all that interested in exploring, you know, the actual alien invasion bit of its plot - and that's a problem."
We Own This City,0,"We Own wanted to be a thundering state-of-the-nation address on race and policing, but forgot that it also had to be interesting."
The White Lotus,0,"The trollish timing of the show's premise, that vacations are wasted on those who least need it, certainly deserves some grudging admiration. But a swerve late in the series disappointingly sails the story toward calmer waters."
The X-Files,0,"And if you are not already a fan, there is no good reason to watch Season 11. The opening episode verged on soap opera, bloated with cringey dialogue and breathy conspiracies."
Big Little Lies,0,"But by the end of season two of Big Little Lies, I not only didn't fully get what I wanted from it, I didn't feel like I got what I needed, either."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,The main storyline isn't strong enough and the incongruous peripheral elements just confuse rather than engage the viewer.
The Offer,0,"Repetitive for anyone who’s seen the film, and condescendingly didactic for those who haven’t."
Fargo,0,"Fargo has always been a little off-kilter, but those elements stand out as particularly indulgent or egregious this season, when its overall storytelling approach is so uneven."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,0,"The final season was a chance for the show to engage in some systemic critique; its attempts to do so, however, largely fell flat... A soft-pedaled version of policing and the people who do it."
The Nevers,0,"There's a lot of that carelessness throughout The Nevers. Or maybe it's just that there's simply a lot happening in The Nevers, and it's hard to keep track of it all."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Nine Perfect Strangers suffers from the same chronic issue that so many television adaptations of juicy novels do: it fails to capture the sneaky, get-under-your-skin tendency of its engrossing source material."
The First,0,"Sluggishly paced and too familiar in its character beats, it's the sort of prestige project that surely looked good on paper but fizzles once exposed to air."
Ginny & Georgia,0,"If the writers trimmed away one or two, the mother-daughter tension at its core could shine. But with so much going on, that dynamic gets lost."
The O.C.,0,"As is perhaps fitting, though, for a show about teenagers and their notoriously short attention spans, the writers found it hard to keep up the momentum and the quality took a dive... It has been clear the show is on its last legs."
The Wonder Years,0,"The old show was escapist, sure, the new one is not, but the inevitable question is why a network remakes a show in a way that largely ignores the charms of the original."
The Outsider,0,"Curiously -- and annoyingly -- uneven, as if different production crews took over on alternate days undoing one another's work."
Star Wars Resistance,0,"The bottom line is that Resistance... isn't really that good, or memorable. More specifically, it's a show that really doesn't know what it wants to be."
After Life,0,"Treated with a little more care, I suppose all of this could be saying really interesting things about male failure and loneliness. It's lazy, though. No idea or message is ever pursued. Nothing is."
Stranger Things,0,"The scrappy, soulful energy that defined Stranger Things‘ early seasons has been thrown out the window, and all that’s left is a parade of ’80s movies Easter eggs and increasingly obvious plot twists."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"If only one of these people would have the decency to drop dead, it would make the show infinitely more engaging."
Altered Carbon,0,"It had good moments, it had bad moments, it had dull moments. I kind of wish now that there was just Season 1 standing alone as a great example of the genre..."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"Maybe a different creative team could've done a better job adapting The Shrink Next Door, or maybe Marty Markowitz's story simply didn't need to be retold."
The Morning Show,0,"You've got to appreciate the moxie of a high-profile streaming series where a character blurts, ""Another streaming service? It should be illegal."" That's The Morning Show's second season in a nutshell: having its cake while choking on it."
The Essex Serpent,0,"Against this beautiful backdrop, the human drama never crackles. Directed by Clio Barnard, the show seems to forget that, along with all the portentous symbolism, there needs to be a spark of wit or a flicker of emotional depth."
And Just Like That...,0,"Why is everyone so dulled down? This brings us to Samantha, whose absence may be the biggest presence on And Just Like That so far. There is no good way to write her out."
Bel-Air,0,"Once upon a time, Will from west Philly was miles from home, but the show he was in knew exactly what it was and where it was going. Bel-Air finds that a difficult trick to replicate."
Suspicion,0,"It feels like Suspicion is a bunch of espionage scenes in search of a cohesive story. The story may reveal itself at some point, but right now, the whole operation feels bland and generic."
Invincible,0,"Invincible has the potential to become a better show, but only if the makers move beyond this adolescent mockery of a superhero series and into a zone of mature storytelling. The ingredients are already there. The mixing needs to be better."
The Nevers,0,To paraphrase Coco Chanel: This is a TV show that should look in the mirror and take off one plot point before exiting the house.
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,0,"Just securing a project featuring Jackson (who produces as well as stars) is probably coup enough for the streaming service, but the marquee value doesn't overcome what turns out to be a slog as a viewing proposition."
Foundation,0,"The time jumps are confusing and the story needs a clearer arc. It doesn't feel immersive enough and, absent the texture of everyday life, the stakes feel too theoretical. The editing is clunky and the show lacks a sense of humor."
Twin Peaks,0,"The show, which derived its power from the aftermath of trauma in a small community, has chosen to tell a story that's odder and bigger -- so big, in fact, that it has so far choked off what made Twin Peaks work all along."
The Sopranos,0,One can understand David Chase's desire to have a completely unique ending... But that doesn't mean we have to like it.
11.22.63,0,"I'm still not entirely convinced about 11.22.63 just yet. While I have always enjoyed Franco as an actor, I'm not getting the sense of conviction that I got from book-Jake."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,0,"The split timeline is a plague on TV, and its latest victim is Showtime’s The Man Who Fell to Earth."
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,0,"The Bad Batch is good to dip into, but it can make for a bad binge."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"It's a top-notch cast, and the collective strengths of the actors make the series sing when the rest is flimsy. But the mystery at the heart of it all... isn't always effective, more an afterthought rather than a prevalent riddle."
Hawkeye,0,"""Hawkeye"" is clearly more concerned with setting up Kate Bishop for future MCU phases than creating a problem worthy of two heroes' time. And at six hours, it's certainly not worthy of yours."
The Capture,0,"It's gripping up to a point, but really it's just you staring at a screen while watching another person staring at a screen."
Marvel's Agent Carter,0,[The setup is] opting for beats so trite that they feel like they're coming out of a spy parody.
Godless,0,"It shows, in a bad way, that the original material was designed for a short film format, and you can tell that there was no script to fill the more than seven hours that the miniseries lasts. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Moon Knight,0,The first three quarters of this six-episode season is a vague story that takes a long time to go nowhere. There's not enough character for a character study and not a clear enough plot for a satisfying thriller.
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"The Punisher was a fun but undeniably flawed series, representative of the Netflix-Marvel universe as a model of frustrating inconsistency."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Atill struggling with the same generic Marvel-on-Netflix issue: a master plot that just isn't dense enough to stretch over the episode order, leading to stop-and-start pacing, repetitive conversations and secondary characters that overstay their welcome."
Inventing Anna,0,"Rhimes isn't shy about availing herself of artistic license. In this story, however, she forgoes fleshing out her characters and bloats each episode's runtime instead."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"The show's skittish unwillingness to look hard at its characters for longer than a monologue dooms it -- not to failure but to a sort of absence, making a show about people in the fight for their lives feel like something to have on in the background."
What If...?,0,"[What If...? is] bite-sized chunks of comic book fun, however [the show doesn't] go further than being half-hearted fan service."
The Morning Show,0,"Too often, The Morning Show's second season is satisfied with the easiness of shock -- of announcing itself, though not communicating much of note, in a blare."
Sweet Tooth,0,"It seems unfair to call a drama about a ruined world a mess, but this feels, quite deliberately, all over the place."
Ozark,0,"The show enters its final seven episodes with a problem: How do you create credible foes and foils for the Byrde's in such a short amount of time?... These rivalries feel like temporary fixes, band-aids applied to a gaping head wound."
Big Little Lies,0,Season two's biggest shortcoming is the way it prioritized Mary-Louise at the expense of Bonnie.
The First Lady,0,"There's never quite enough from any one first lady, which leaves a sense of disappointment. It's unfortunately a show that is lesser than the sum of its Emmy- and Oscar-winning parts."
All of Us Are Dead,0,It's delivered in an oddly-paced season that fights against an intuitive structure as much as these students try to beat back chomps from throngs of kids in uniforms.
X-Men,0,The series fizzled to an end.
Peacemaker,0,"Gunn has given himself and his actors more room to play than he's ever been allotted - eight hours' worth - and hasn't figured out how to fill it with anything but the same labored joke, again and again and again."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"""Marvel's Jessica Jones"" gets off on the wrong foot in Season 3 and stays there until the lackluster end."
Pretty Little Liars,0,It's time for Pretty Little Liars to put us out of our misery once and for all. It's an act of mercy that we all deserve.
Castle Rock,0,There's little apparent benefit to how the show's second season foregrounds its interpersonal relationships.
Man vs. Bee,0,"Despite its enticing if predictable premise, Man vs. Bee lacks a sting in its tail."
Succession,0,"I come not to bury ""Succession"" nor to praise it, but to perpetually hope it will take up that messy space between paranoia and performative nonchalance."
Archive 81,0,"Netflix's new horror show Archive 81 offers promising scares and intrigue across the board, but in its execution, it forgets the most important thing: the characters."
The Morning Show,0,"If the first season was about the Me Too movement, the second season is about... well, I'm not sure really. The show says so much without saying anything at all."
Starstruck,0,"The reason why romantic comedies never have sequels is because either everything is going well with the couple and there’s nothing to watch. Or, there is conflict and the original love story is ruined. Starstruck’s second season suffers from the latter."
The Book of Boba Fett,0,"Favreau scattered story crumbs onto the table and expected hungry viewers to squish them together and call it cake... It's a short-term high, but I believe this business is going destroy this franchise expansion if it's replicated in the spinoffs to come."
The Boys,0,"Its bleak viewing experience might appeal to some audiences, but it’s likely to leave more than a few viewers wishing the entire cast of characters would just be put out of their misery."
The Morning Show,0,"""The Morning Show"" has become such a media object of fascination, I think, not just because the odds were so heavily stacked in its favor, but because it ultimately squanders so much of its potential."
True Detective,0,"It is neither as raw and gripping as the series' rookie season nor as structurally unsound as its second. It is good, not great."
WandaVision,0,"Based on the first three episodes, 'Wanda Vision' does not deliver the unique entertainment one might expect. However there are indications there may be a brighter future."
Sharp Objects,0,"It has everything to be a hit, but Sharp Objects does not captivate. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Tokyo Vice,0,What would Japanese people do without Americans around to explain everything to them?
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"Here's the most unforgivable sin of the second season of The Punisher: You have a magnificent performance like this one at your disposal, and this is what you choose to do with it?"
The Mist,0,There's room for interesting rehashes that bring new perspectives and ideas. The Mist is definitely not one of them.One adaptation was enough.
Little Voice,0,Never tries something original when a cliché will do instead.
WeCrashed,0,Apple TV's first high-profile letdown doesn't know whether to satirise WeWork founder Adam Neumann or to idolise him.
And Just Like That...,0,"Modernizing the original's much-beloved and extremely glamorous world has for some reason meant making it drearier, more awkward, and overall less joyful to inhabit."
Earth to Ned,0,Alien puppet talk show falls short of Muppet expectations.
Arrested Development,0,"The more you know about what's happened with Tambor over the past 12 months and the cast's attempt to reframe it, the emptier the comedy's absurdist spectacle becomes."
The First Lady,0,"For all its glossy sheen and good intentions, The First Lady has little to offer that feels truly, meaningfully “real.”"
Killing Eve,0,I think most will be disappointed at how far from the first two seasons this series has gone and be thankful that they wont be dragging it out much longer.
Little Fires Everywhere,0,...the series is driven by a muddle-headed and confused notion about what's wrong with the U.S...
Heroes,0,"Maybe I'm coming off a little harsh, but after so many years of mediocre storytelling and promises of things being better, I'm over it."
The Beatles: Get Back,0,"The Beatles: Get Back only truly comes to life when the eponymous band performs, and it happens far less than you might want over the course of 8 hours."
The Undoing,0,"This should all be sexily entertaining, and even fun, with Kidman and Hugh Grant playing Grace and Jonathan, and Kelley supplying the banter they exchange around the townhouse kitchen island. And for one episode it is."
The Big Bang Theory,0,"I'm not sure if they got the physics exactly right, but The Big Bang Theory somehow ended not with a breakup but an ""I love you."""
Schmigadoon!,0,"Simply put, it's sporadically fun but a little too cute for its own good."
The Undoing,0,"What starts out as a lively drama about scandal among the one percent turns into a turgid thriller and later a courtroom drama, recalling some of the hackier tendencies of past Kelley shows."
The X-Files,0,"If only Fox would do us a favor and stop bringing this one back. Fans get their hopes up, only to see them crushed again."
Battlestar Galactica,0,"To be honest, I'm weary of Baltar and his endless visions/hallucinations, as I am of the fleet's wandering as the surviving colonists try, somewhat fitfully, to find their way back to a home planet none of them remembers."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,This could have been eight episodes.
Joe vs Carole,0,"It's called Joe vs. Carole, but it should have been called Dumb vs Dumber."
The Nevers,0,"If The Nevers does get to continue, having someone else in charge could be the special power it really needs."
The Pentaverate,0,"Returning to the prosthetics and puns that helped make Austin Powers a classic was an inherent risk, but it might have been worth it with better writing."
The Twilight Zone,0,"Technophobic and misogynistic... you're better than this, Twilight Zone."
Godless,0,"Jeff Daniels and Michelle Dockery seeking new sorts of roles is admirable, but the results need a bit of tweaking."
After Life,0,It's a season that betrays its own legacy and destroys the absolute brilliance of the first season.
Rise,0,"When Rise shifts focus to one of Robbie's big games, it becomes painfully apparent how effortlessly Friday Night Lights stirred the emotions Rise struggles to find. It's not until the season finale that the show realizes its full tear-jerking potential."
And Just Like That...,0,There were many inclusivity themes as a lunge for relevance that only make you remember how funny and risky the un-PC Samantha could have made it.
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,0,"Just securing a project featuring Jackson (who produces as well as stars) is probably coup enough for the streaming service, but the marquee value doesn't overcome what turns out to be a slog as a viewing proposition."
Invasion,0,Invasion proceeds so incrementally across such a wide range of characters and their responses to extraterrestrial terrorism that you might well lose your way from week to week. Never mind your interest.
Casual,0,"Somehow... the series keeps from being overwhelmed by all the changes, either to its characters or the world around them, and winds up in delivering an emotionally satisfying end to one of Hulu's most charming and enjoyable series."
The X-Files,0,"The adjustments made for the opening episode show less of the kind of creative skills that made episodes like ""Triangle,"" ""Home"" and ""Ice"" so memorable and come across as a uninspired solution to what looked like an unfixable situation."
Castle Rock,0,"In this misguided series, the clash between grounded psychological horror and bump-in-the-night monster mania delivers fewer shivers than shrugs of confusion."
Man vs. Bee,0,"After a certain point, you stop questioning things and instead enter a fugue state. Is time passing, or are you just stuck in some horrendous ten-minute long Groundhog Day?"
Elite,0,"By its new fifth season, Élite finally arrives at the point where it can no longer pull off its gimmicks."
Pieces of Her,0,"Well acted and highly suspenseful, the eight-part Netflix thriller “Pieces of Her” never lets up. This is a good thing for the first five episodes. Then it grows exhausting."
Mr. Corman,0,Even the presence of Debra Winger as Josh's mom... and Juno Temple as his ex (a character who feels too ill-defined to really work) feel like wasted opportunities.
The First Lady,0,The show ultimately plays like a prestige (and repetitive) reenactment of each First Lady's Wikipedia page.
Chernobyl,0,"We should be engaged by the tragic flaws and nobility of all this by this point, but the story and characters have gone so uncorralled that it takes all your viewing energy just to keep it fractionally straight."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,It's all meant to be a paean to the imagination. Too bad the effects pry some of us out of our imaginations and into the tech lab.
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"As it nears the end of its run, the series doesn't seem to have much more to say about trauma."
Safe,0,It's a thriller by numbers that doesn't feel clever enough for its talented cast.
Stranger Things,0,"""Stranger Things"" is back after a three-year hiatus, but it's hard to say it's a welcome arrival."
Lovecraft Country,0,The problem isn't that Lovecraft Country doesn't meet the expectation of a Lovecraft fan; the problem is that it uses Lovecraft tropes superficially and doesn't exploit their strengths.
Wolf Like Me,0,Wolf Like Me takes its traumatic situation so seriously I kept waiting for it to let its hair down.
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Is this an erotic thriller? A courtroom drama? An expose of social issues? At times it is all of these things, though most of the time it exists in the listless space between any clear genre -- or sense of identity."
Vigil,0,"According to the end credits, Vigil has been made with support from the Scottish government, which makes no secret of its opposition to nuclear weapons. That may hint at an extra political edge, but doesn't make this a compelling drama."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,0,"However, season seven took this farther than it had to, losing the series' signature comedy and making it feel more like a chore to watch week to week than anything else."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"The cast of Nine Perfect Strangers is too good for the limited series to ever be unwatchable. But after seeing six of eight hour-long episodes, I'm pretty sure the biggest mystery has nothing to do with any of the damaged characters."
Pieces of Her,0,"Collete is as watchable as always; she deserves better than this, though."
Lisey's Story,0,"Lisey's Story is pretty to look at and fairly faithful, but far too bloated to be very engaging."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,Anatomy of a Scandal most resembles a soap opera you’d watch in order to have something on in the background. But the ultra-serious subject matter make it an impossible mindless watch.
Game of Thrones,0,Season eight made the regrettable mistake of giving half its time to an underwhelming villain at the expense of the characters who made the show special in the first place.
Waco,0,"What Waco needs, and fails to achieve, is a complex, unified theory of Koresh."
Lovecraft Country,0,"Right now, between the messy narrative, bendable rules, and buckets of blood, it's just too hard to get a grip on ""Lovecraft Country."""
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,0,"The show feels like more Star Wars: Clone Wars, and yet never reaches the heights that it's sister series did, and ultimately doesn't find it's own voice as a result."
The Wheel of Time,0,"I never felt like I was watching an unfolding story, but I absolutely felt like I was watching the whiteboard in a writers room, more the pushing of note cards toward a destination than an adventure."
And Just Like That...,0,"If the iconic image of ""Sex and the City"" is its central quartet striding down a Manhattan sidewalk, this is a series on its back heels: defensive, reactive, terrified to offend."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"The premise sounds so simple and fruitful. But despite all the talent involved, the result is confusing, landing in a no-man's-land between comedy, drama and thriller."
The First,0,"The seriousness of the subject doesn't entirely explain the solemnity of this pilot episode, nor the glacial pacing."
Treadstone,0,"A show whose ambition to try to capture a world's worth of adventure seems, too often, like taking the easy way out from digging too deeply into story or character."
The Gilded Age,0,Wharton is unlikely to have approved of such a half-hearted imitation of her work.
Sex/Life,0,"Sex/Life drowns itself in the shallow end, so to speak, by failing to even generate much heat. There are plenty of R-rated scenes-so many, actually, that they get repetitive."
The Offer,0,"Unfortunately, the resulting product is frequently too on-the-nose. If there’s any reason to watch, it’s for the performance of actor Matthew Goode as legendary Paramount executive Robert Evans."
The Nevers,0,"The Nevers is muddled, overcrowded, and less-than-engaging despite its complex lore and flashy special effects."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Despite risible dialogue and a disturbing swing toward cheap theatrics, this weak but watchable legal thriller still puts a human face on the MeToo movement thanks to committed, compelling performances from Sienna Miller and Michelle Dockery."
The Morning Show,0,"""The Morning Show"" has become such a media object of fascination, I think, not just because the odds were so heavily stacked in its favor, but because it ultimately squanders so much of its potential."
The Big Bang Theory,0,"I'm not sure if they got the physics exactly right, but The Big Bang Theory somehow ended not with a breakup but an ""I love you."""
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"Overall The Time Travelers Wife is funny and poignant in its best moments, but uncomfortable and cringe-worthy at its worst."
Entourage,0,"""Entourage"" heads into its final eight episodes starting Sunday night and to be honest, it's time."
Hannibal,0,It's difficult to love a show that seems to be trying to hard to be impenetrable to viewers to the point that it's practically begging to be canceled with such uninviting storytelling.
Amazing Stories,0,"The upside of any anthology series is the possibility that the next installment can completely turn things around with a brand-new tale. Still, if this is the show's best foot forward, it doesn't imply much optimism."
Inventing Anna,0,"Inventing Anna is a meandering and shallow take on Anna Sorokin's story, glacially paced with superfluous tangents that distract from the character we're really interested in."
First Kill,0,"As a cheesy teen soap with supernatural elements, First Kill holds some promise, but that quickly dissipates as the eight-episode season progresses."
The Fall,0,"As good as Anderson is throughout, her Stella suffers from a Season 3 lack of development -- we learn nothing about her in this new season that we did not know from the previous two."
Heroes,0,"Maybe I'm coming off a little harsh, but after so many years of mediocre storytelling and promises of things being better, I'm over it."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"A paint-by-numbers thriller that ostensibly investigates the nature of sexual consent without really making us feel invested in any of the characters involved, however well-acted."
Friends,0,"The ""Friends"" soap opera ended predictably and blandly last night, with no big surprises, just two little ones -- Monica's and Chandler's twins."
Vikings: Valhalla,0,"If youre just here to up the historical combat quotient in your screen diet, have at it. But dont expect much else."
Invasion,0,"Take away the aliens, and what's left is essentially the sprawling network family drama series This Is Us."
Battlestar Galactica,0,I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE YELLED AT A SHOW LIKE THIS. I WAS ROOTING FOR YOU. WE WERE ALL ROOTING FOR YOU! HOW DARE YOU!
Interrogation,0,Perhaps more frustrating is that some of our time in the '80s is given to us free of a person's recollection of events.
Dr. Brain,0,"Too often Dr. Brain dodges the dark freakiness of its central idea and instead lingers on rote, slow-moving mystery plotting."
Invasion,0,"While it's an ambitious, sometimes welcome subversion of the genre, the approach often works to the series' detriment."
House of Cards,0,"The gaping cynicism of these faux Washington insiders also paints a depressing picture of the actual current climate, especially against the backdrop of the real-life controversy in the White House."
The Wheel of Time,0,"The Wheel Of Time is definitely a talky mess of a show, at least to start. It throws a lot of characters at us, but somehow all the time taken to establish them doesn't give us any more idea about them than when the episode started."
Ozark,0,"The show enters its final seven episodes with a problem: How do you create credible foes and foils for the Byrde's in such a short amount of time?... These rivalries feel like temporary fixes, band-aids applied to a gaping head wound."
The Afterparty,0,"The Afterparty squanders the talents of its cast with a broad, derivative and annoyingly obnoxious screenplay."
Peacemaker,0,"Gunn has given himself and his actors more room to play than he's ever been allotted - eight hours' worth - and hasn't figured out how to fill it with anything but the same labored joke, again and again and again."
The Fall,0,"This show thinks it is Very Important Viewing, unmissable drama, televisual literature. The fact is it's very missable indeed."
The Fall,0,"Its hallmark traits of knife-edge tension, sexual discussion and psychologically-charged scenes have been posted missing, and replaced with an hour of medical procedures and jargon that would bore the most ardent of E.R. fans."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Hulu trotted out Little Fires Everywhere, an eight-part limited series that attempts to capture the sprawling nature of the source material, but ultimately fails."
Cheers,0,Yuk. Writers Glen Charles and Les Charles crammed more sloppy sentimental stuff into the last 15 minutes of Thursday's finale than the show exhibited in its entire 11 years.
The Problem With Jon Stewart,0,"[It] feels like Stewart's attempt to evolve what he used to do for a new era. He just hasn't figured out how to do it yet, and may be too entrenched in his old approach to succeed for anyone beyond the most die-hard Daily Show With Jon Stewart fans."
Behind Her Eyes,0,"Behind Her Eyes just doesn't know what it wants to be and takes itself far too seriously, resulting in a muddled mess that could - and should - have been cut short."
Chucky,0,"Ultimately, there are better, scarier things you can be watching than Chucky."
Defending Jacob,0,"""Defending Jacob"" has great ingredients, but the portion size is off."
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,"Luke Cage might be bulletproof, but the character's eponymous Netflix series looks weaker in Season 2 -- not bad, overall, but still experiencing the equivalent of a sophomore slump."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,0,"While I was happy to see Estevez on screen, the character is flat and unpleasant, giving little explanation about his backstory until episode three."
Dr. Death,0,"Despite the show's few thrills, its structure only reveals an unsteady grasp of the story at its center."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"I had the same uneasy reaction to the podcast itself, and I bailed on Shrink early, in both incarnations. But hey, there's obviously an audience for this."
Altered Carbon,0,"I found myself desperately wishing for Altered Carbon to leave its world of endless lives, satellite back ups, and shapeless political revolutions behind, to focus... on the AIs discarded by humanity as yet another resource to be wasted and forgotten."
The Wheel of Time,0,"Early on, the wanderers take refuge in a cursed city, its deserted streets lined with baroque architecture and statuary. ""Wheel,"" as a production, feels like that. It's a breathtakingly detailed edifice with no people in it."
The Nevers,0,The Nevers begins with an intriguing premise and develops it in such a plodding way that interest progressively fades with each successive hour.
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"The fights lack any excitement, physically or emotionally. There are a couple of fights where it felt like a constant back and forth with a punch, block, repeat."
And Just Like That...,0,"The name surely carries plenty of equity, but like the movies, this HBO Max show yields diminishing returns."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,0,"For a series dedicated to supposed historical realism, Downton Abbey wraps things up with a bow of pure fantasy."
The Undoing,0,The real disappointment lies in the degree to which The Undoing shows itself to be simply a cheesy thriller.
Wolf Like Me,0,Wolf Like Me takes its traumatic situation so seriously I kept waiting for it to let its hair down.
The Haunting of Hill House,0,"Like everything in Hill House, that terror gets muted, slowed down and picked over so much that it ends up banal and lifeless."
Defending Jacob,0,"The result is a story that feels both overstuffed and underdeveloped. Like its namesake, Defending Jacob is brought down just as it's taking off."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"This is serious subject matter, but it’s hard not to laugh at some bizarrely surreal flourishes, the howlingly bad dialogue and the preposterously prim accents."
Limitless,0,"Yet while Limitless is competently executed, what it lacks, finally, is any spark of inspiration. And alas, there's no pill for that."
Lovecraft Country,0,"Lovecraft Country feels like a missed opportunity to repurpose the racist fear at the heart of Lovecraft's work to articulate the specific dread, isolation, and social death felt by Black people in all corners of the world."
Monsters at Work,0,An unremarkable journey through ideas we've already seen done better before.
Twin Peaks,0,"""I am dead. Yet I live,"" [Laura Palmer] said. Much the same could be said of the revival, which resembles a danse macabre, full of familiar steps, but with some new missteps all of its own."
Star Wars Resistance,0,"The bottom line is that Resistance... isn't really that good, or memorable. More specifically, it's a show that really doesn't know what it wants to be."
11.22.63,0,"The resulting eight-part miniseries is an uneven affair, at times feeling as if it's meandering through history en route to its frantic closing kick."
Euphoria,0,"Euphoria is unrelentingly explicit this time around, as if it took one look at its former self and thought: no, not shocking enough, try this."
The Crown,0,The show seriously falters with Diana... The Crown prides itself on verisimilitude and that starts to fall away in Season 4.
Bel-Air,0,"The missing element here is the camp of a juicy soap. If we can’t laugh, then we should gasp. Remaking an iconic series is a silly endeavor—why not lean all the way into that?"
And Just Like That...,0,"And Just Like That... A New Chapter of Sex and the City is a clumsy, cringe-inducing revival that fails to recapture the magic of the original."
The Big Bang Theory,0,"However big a role pop culture may have played in its stories, the show itself could never have served as a barometer for the rest of pop culture. It's impossible to be a meaningful barometer if the dial only ever reads one thing."
Hawkeye,0,"Even a show that approaches its episodic run like an extra-long movie owes the audience a bit more momentum than this, especially when those installments roll out weekly."
"Web of Make Believe: Death, Lies & the Internet",0,While all of the subjects covered in the six episodes sound very interesting a lot of the oomph is taken out of them due to the repetitive and drawn out nature of each.
The Stand,0,"Somehow this isn't really what I want to watch in the throes of COVID 19, especially as it's not a great adaptation."
Limitless,0,"This is a mediocre rehash of Intelligence, which was already a humorless rip off of Chuck."
Schmigadoon!,0,It's one of those comedies that works well enough at the moment and only loses the melody when one considers how great it could and should have been.
The Stand,0,"Stripping this story of pretty much every shred of dramatic weight and emotional engagement is no easy task, but CBS has accomplished it"
Dave,0,"Dave is still a biting satire set within the music industry that depicts the many pitfalls of making it to the main stage at Coachella. But especially this season, it's sometimes difficult to watch."
The First Lady,0,"You will find no objections from me to giving each of these real women a chance to fill a whole series with their dualities, tensions, and complications. But there’s very little of that realness here."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"This Iron Fist ain't immortal, he's got a real short shelf life."
Arrested Development,0,No programme is more infuriatingly chuffed with itself.
The Wheel of Time,0,It all feels somewhat conventional. Is it the show's fault or because many fantasy film and television adaptations have already been made? [Full review in Spanish]
Wolf Like Me,0,"Wolf Like Me aims high, but ends up howling at the moon with some deeply implausible parental angst"
Elite,0,"By its new fifth season, Élite finally arrives at the point where it can no longer pull off its gimmicks."
The X-Files,0,"Based on five episodes made available for preview, things remain uneven -- the first episode is dragged down by more conspiracy blather, interminable voiceover and way too many apocalyptic predictions of doom."
The Crown,0,"Sadly, what we get here from the Peter Morgan-created series is substantially tweaked timelines and substandard soap that is far less ""character"" and more live-action spitting image caricature."
The Mist,0,"Not nearly enough horror, way too much exposition (in the opener). Even the fog seems a little bored hanging around for something to happen."
Chucky,0,"Ultimately, there are better, scarier things you can be watching than Chucky."
Godless,0,"Godless foregrounds by-the-book gunslingers and manhunts that take a promising concept and translate it into familiar, if handsomely presented, clich."
Lisey's Story,0,"Acknowledging its prettiness and production values, and some excellent performances, I found it better than unbearable but something less than beautiful."
Roar,0,"The problem of Roar might just be the curse of inconsistency that always follows around anthologies. But this feels like something more serious than a case of variable quality, and instead something more existential for the show itself. On"
Legion,0,Legion is weird for weird's sake and seems content to do that right up to the end.
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Despite able performers and potent themes, the show is so addicted to chaos that it squanders its chance to say anything substantive."
The Thing About Pam,0,"A watchable if often underwhelming true crime docudrama that wants to both be weird and play it safe, ending up in a strange middle ground between the two."
The Staircase,0,"True crime is not something to be toyed with, and The Staircase, for all the beautiful work put into it, toys with viewers instead of finding the salient truths about the case."
The Fall,0,"This show thinks it is Very Important Viewing, unmissable drama, televisual literature. The fact is it's very missable indeed."
The Mosquito Coast,0,The tone-deaf tourism of The Mosquito Coast makes for an adventure that's increasingly difficult to go along with.
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,Light on romantic chemistry and heavy on the cringe.
Lovecraft Country,0,"There's something mechanical about Lovecraft Country's horror, both real and supernatural."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"Though the second season attempts to redefine who its title character is and where he fits within this corner of the superhero universe, the end result is both an odd fit and a moot point."
Chucky,0,"Ultimately, there are better, scarier things you can be watching than Chucky."
Brave New World,0,"Not only have we had a ton of sci-fi dystopias lately, but Huxley's novel is one of the most popular and enduring ever; most of the stuff you're sick of was already cribbed from it in the first place. That puts this new series in a tricky position"
Our Flag Means Death,0,"While in some ways, Bonnet is a role [Darby] was born to play, with plenty of opportunities for flailing both verbally and visually, many audience members may find he quickly grates."
The Wheel of Time,0,"I never felt like I was watching an unfolding story, but I absolutely felt like I was watching the whiteboard in a writers room, more the pushing of note cards toward a destination than an adventure."
Legion,0,"I responded to moments of Legion because I vibed with its project, but all of the aspects of that project ended up working better in other shows."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"On the whole, the series' inability to decide whether to play things straight or lean into the Ferrell and Rudd reunion makes it hard to get used to anything that's happening."
Tokyo Vice,0,"After that first episode ends, and Mann hands off the show to other directors, an impression starts to build that the best ""Vice'' has to offer is behind it."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"I had the same uneasy reaction to the podcast itself, and I bailed on Shrink early, in both incarnations. But hey, there's obviously an audience for this."
The Bletchley Circle,0,"Instead of stroking suspense, the show starts and stops in fits, never finding a thrilling stride that unites the mysteries and deepens characterizations. Let's hope that Anna isn't on a permanent vacation."
Killing Eve,0,"From the first time Jodie Comer pressed a knife to Sandra Oh’s throat, the sexy murder drama seemed to promise one thing. Frustrated fans are right to be disappointed."
Loot,0,"Because [Rudolph] can do almost anything, a temptation exists to create roles that allow her to do everything. And that can result in a tonal jumble like Loot, which feels like a lot of great raw material in search of a series to make sense of it all."
Pieces of Her,0,The latest example of a miniseries that long overstays its welcome.
Little Voice,0,The stakes are ludicrously low.
Roar,0,"The problem of Roar might just be the curse of inconsistency that always follows around anthologies. But this feels like something more serious than a case of variable quality, and instead something more existential for the show itself. On"
Defending Jacob,0,"Better to leave audiences craving more than demanding less, I suppose, but Defending Jacob boasts a tremendous ensemble of actors who make you wish they had the rich characterizations they deserve."
The Haunting of Hill House,0,"Most frustratingly, the adaptation abandons the raw feminine perversity that made Jackson's story so indelible."
How I Met Your Mother,0,This finale seems to completely sour the show's legacy - something that is not more important than ever.
The Morning Show,0,"You've got to appreciate the moxie of a high-profile streaming series where a character blurts, ""Another streaming service? It should be illegal."" That's The Morning Show's second season in a nutshell: having its cake while choking on it."
The Nevers,0,The Nevers has a lot going for it but it's a distillation of Whedon's best and worst filmmaking impulses. It needs someone with a more disciplined eye to cut half of its many dangling threads and subplots.
Loki,0,"Loki feels too constrained, too stale, for a story about a wayward god of mischief. Too much exposition bogs down the script."
Brave New World,0,"Despite some evocative (and provocative) visuals and appropriate dramatic tension, it fails to truly excite."
Taboo,0,"What it lacks, unfortunately, is Thrones' sweep, moments of playfulness and narrative drive - or any drive at all."
Godless,0,"Jeff Daniels and Michelle Dockery seeking new sorts of roles is admirable, but the results need a bit of tweaking."
Waco,0,"Waco won't be the first drama to reduce a tragedy to its simplest components, but this doesn't offer much confidence that these are the right components or the only ones."
Once Upon a Time,0,Once Upon a Time's magic is gone.
Defending Jacob,0,"This limited series strains for impact. But it's unserious about the aspects of its story that are genuinely potentially interesting, and sillier than one might have any reason to expect."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,0,"In its first episode, The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers resembles its scrappy kids: uneasy on the ice and a little afraid to take shots."
You,0,"The stakes with ""You"" always lie in Joe being a protagonist you root against. But by season three's end, we stopped enjoying the ride - all we want is for Joe to receive his comeuppance."
Lost,0,Like the televisual equivalent of a keyboard-pounding poet... At least we know that we'll only have to suffer through one more season of this foolishness.
The Undoing,0,The Undoing becomes overly long and formulaic. It's less interesting than Big Little Lies and has less on its mind socio-politically than Little Fires Everywhere.
Stranger Things,0,Stranger Things is still Stranger Things. It just now comes with astoundingly thick levels of padding.
The Endgame,0,"Sure its fun to watch Baccarin regard Bathe with the same kind of amused regard an older brother gives to his younger siblings attempts at tackling him, but it gives The Endgame zero sense of stakes."
Moon Knight,0,"The rickety action sequences, paired with questionable CGI, drippy horror, terrible jokes, a shoddily assembled mystery and one too many rounds of over-the-top violence combine to make Moon Knight an unfortunate dud on the Marvel roster."
Lovecraft Country,0,Lovecraft Country links to literary racism simply for fake topicality. Anti-American nihilism and hopeless racial cynicism give the show its gotcha.
The Pentaverate,0,"There are rare parts of The Pentaverate that demonstrate how Mike Myers' brand of humor can still feel fun and fresh here in 2022, but too much of it proves the opposite."
Battlestar Galactica,0,A lot of basic and mundane things don't add up for me.
The Nevers,0,As creaky as these first four episodes are - reams of exposition alternating between soap-opera twists and cutesy inventions like Penance's li'l electric car - I want to believe there are glimmers of promise.
The Baby,0,"Haphazardly careens from one idea to another, throwing in themes and plot threads that never properly fit together."
The Gilded Age,0,Wharton is unlikely to have approved of such a half-hearted imitation of her work.
The First Lady,0,"You will find no objections from me to giving each of these real women a chance to fill a whole series with their dualities, tensions, and complications. But there’s very little of that realness here."
Bridgerton,0,"While “Bridgerton” Season 2 arrives with all of the scandal, gossip, and sartorial excellence we’ve become accustomed to, the sophomore outing lacks the fresh appeal and engaging pace of the first season."
Our Flag Means Death,0,"Ultimately, it’s got enough amusing moments and talented performers to offer some comedic escapism once a week, but anyone looking for another “Shadows” or “Flight of the Conchords,” should sail to other waters."
Arrested Development,0,No programme is more infuriatingly chuffed with itself.
Lovecraft Country,0,"Lovecraft Country is within its rights to use people as a vehicle for a story, rather than vice versa-but the story has to be considered and focused enough to be worth the trade-off."
WandaVision,0,"The first three-ish episodes were very fun, and then it pretty quickly turned into a long Marvel movie."
The Right Stuff,0,"The actors do their best to overcome the flat writing, and the show does find its stride by the fifth episode. What the new ""Right Stuff"" is missing are the qualities it can probably never have: currency and context."
Killing Eve,0,"Like a bad romance, Killing Eve is keeping its couple apart without logical or emotional justification. In the process, it’s dulled the spark provided by these two excellent actors as well as the tension sustained by their taste for danger."
Killing Eve,0,"With only eight episodes in the series, it’s time to stop idling and hit the gas pedal. And new characters and errant plot threads only hinder what should be the driving force of the series, namely the Eve and Villanelle relationship."
Lovecraft Country,0,"Lovecraft Country feels like a missed opportunity to repurpose the racist fear at the heart of Lovecraft's work to articulate the specific dread, isolation, and social death felt by Black people in all corners of the world."
The Endgame,0,"Sure its fun to watch Baccarin regard Bathe with the same kind of amused regard an older brother gives to his younger siblings attempts at tackling him, but it gives The Endgame zero sense of stakes."
Lisey's Story,0,An eight-episode gluepot.
A Wilderness of Error,0,"""A Wilderness of Error"" offers a not-so-illuminating message that it's sometimes difficult to get at the truth that's not worth the five hours it takes to hear it."
Coyote,0,Assembled from spare parts left over from previous television trends and decaying prejudices.
Moon Knight,0,"The newest MCU series on Disney+ has some interesting ideas and cool authentically Egyptian flavor, but takes its own little time to get rolling."
Doctor Who,0,Legend of the Sea Devils was quite disappointing. I appreciated the fresh scenery and all-Asian guest cast but the Sea Devils fell flat mostly due to poor directing taking all the excitement away from their fight scenes.
And Just Like That...,0,"And Just Like That... isn't nearly as clever, funny or as interesting as it thinks it is."
Moon Knight,0,"Moon Knight is a snooze fest. Most of it is about MacGuffins ... and as the hero and villain chase, find, and procure them, the new Marvel series becomes too plot driven. (This also results in obvious and unnecessary exposition.)"
Halo,0,"iHaloi looks a lot like well you might expect an adaptation of the game would, but it fails to distinguish itself from similar sci-fi fare."
The Boondocks,0,The Boondocks is wrapping up its run by being more like Al Pacino as Al Pacino in Jack and Jill: a sad-looking shell of itself that sometimes recaptures its past spark but has seen better days.
The Mist,0,"This version tries to have it both ways - goofy and serious - and leaves viewers on the outside looking in, rooting for the mist instead of those running from it."
Big Little Lies,0,"HBO, determined to win some more Emmys, and replicate the lighting-in-a-bottle brilliance that was season one, made a season that fails to justify its existence."
Man vs. Bee,0,"After a certain point, you stop questioning things and instead enter a fugue state. Is time passing, or are you just stuck in some horrendous ten-minute long Groundhog Day?"
The Nevers,0,"The world still feels under construction and confused about what its purpose is, something that feels indicative of the lack of a consistent architect throughout."
Prison Break,0,"The reality is that Prison Break in 2017 is basically a collection of ideas that Homeland passed on, if you can imagine that."
Joe vs Carole,0,"Later in the season, Joe yells, “Nobody watches ‘Duck Dynasty’ for the ducks!” This show is all ducks."
Gossip Girl,0,"With age comes wisdom? Whoever said that should have passed the memo to the Gossip Girl gang, because after six seasons, they're still as clueless as ever."
The White Lotus,0,"Without a more cohesive story giving it narrative momentum, it often becomes a series of vignettes involving awful, irredeemable people who never make the right choice - and whether that's entertaining or even stomachable really depends on your mileage."
The X-Files,0,"I'm glad Gillian Anderson isn't coming back for next season because if this is the direction the show is taking us, it's time for it to end."
Invasion,0,Invasion proceeds so incrementally across such a wide range of characters and their responses to extraterrestrial terrorism that you might well lose your way from week to week. Never mind your interest.
Mayor of Kingstown,0,Mostly Renner just acts tired and frustrated. The feeling is contagious.
Lisey's Story,0,Lisey's Story is a mess in almost every conceivable way.
Gaslit,0,"Roberts simply feels miscast as Martha, to whom she bears no resemblance, physical or otherwise."
Inventing Anna,0,A dull spin on an otherwise captivating story...
Gaslit,0,"The particularities of the way Nixonian paranoia played itself out over the national landscape defy easy comparison, and yet the show makes frequent, flat gestures towards the modern day."
The Offer,0,"Repetitive for anyone who’s seen the film, and condescendingly didactic for those who haven’t."
Suspicion,0,Suspicion is a show consistently filled with incident it can sometimes trick you into thinking it is complex.
Amazing Stories,0,"Maybe the show will get better; I hope it does. But with so many shows on so many different platforms right now, it seems like Amazing Stories blew its one chance to make a good first impression."
Entourage,0,"The show's best days are behind it, and the eighth-and-final-season curtain appears to be coming down none too soon."
Godless,0,"Godless is an almighty letdown. The narrative is as expansive as the vast New Mexico plains that form its backdrop, but there's too much creative tumbleweed."
Angelyne,0,I liked “Angelyne” better as it went on... without ever being wholly convinced that it was a trip I needed to take.
Friends,0,"Altogether, Friends is really just a bland show about bland characters living bland lives."
The Boys,0,"Its bleak viewing experience might appeal to some audiences, but it’s likely to leave more than a few viewers wishing the entire cast of characters would just be put out of their misery."
The Office,0,"The Office definitively answers a few key questions about the cogs at the middling paper company Dunder Mifflin - if anyone out there is still interested in the once smart, now just silly sitcom."
Invasion,0,"Take away the aliens, and what's left is essentially the sprawling network family drama series This Is Us."
The Pentaverate,0,The Pentaverate struggles under the weight of its main talent.
Once Upon a Time,0,Once Upon a Time's magic is gone.
And Just Like That...,0,"If the iconic image of ""Sex and the City"" is its central quartet striding down a Manhattan sidewalk, this is a series on its back heels: defensive, reactive, terrified to offend."
The Offer,0,"Viewers would be better off watching the Godfather saga, as its a better use of their time  and its far more entertaining than the entirety of this series."
Inventing Anna,0,"Despite its more evocative performances, Inventing Anna demands patience that doesn’t pay off, squandering its promising potential along the way."
Shining Girls,0,Too many threads are left dangling or unexplained. You never get that satisfying feeling of everything clicking into place by the end.
Guilty Party,0,"Guilty Party's opening episode presents us with an unbelievable, uncharismatic lead character who seems out of place and ill-equipped for every room she enters."
The Outsider,0,"The stakes here seem to be massive; gradually, it becomes clear that an epidemic of darkness is overtaking many. But getting there, with so little in the way of character or freshness of tone, simply exhausts even an interested viewer."
The Endgame,0,"Morena Baccarin and Ryan Michelle Bathe, longtime supporting players getting starring roles in a large-scale series for the first time, do not feel irreplaceable, and the show's clunky, obvious writing doesn't give them much to work with."
Arrested Development,0,"Coming across more like a tribute band to the series itself and ditching the controversial experimentation of 2013's Season 4, this second season of the comedy... is simply less original for a show that used to spark with cleverness."
Lost,0,"The series, which started with so much promise, stalled some time in its third season and will now be remembered as a monstrosity that fused kitsch to camp."
13 Reasons Why,0,The empathy of the first season has vanished completely. [Full Review in Spanish]
Brave New World,0,"Welcome to this not-so Brave New World, where all the ideas feel old and not nearly as deeply considered as the creators think. But, hey, at least it all looks fabulous."
Severance,0,"If the series wants to tackle the exploitation of labor, even in its own exaggerated way, it usually helps when the authoritarians' methods of oppression make sense—logically and emotionally..."
Lisey's Story,0,"Apple's Stephen King Miniseries Starts Off Strong, Only to Quickly Fall Apart."
Limitless,0,"This is a mediocre rehash of Intelligence, which was already a humorless rip off of Chuck."
Brave New World,0,"Miniseries that scratches on Aldous Huxley's novel, staying on the surface. [Full review in Spanish]"
The First Lady,0,"For all its glossy sheen and good intentions, The First Lady has little to offer that feels truly, meaningfully “real.”"
They Call Me Magic,0,"If viewers don’t already know the stories Johnson has previously told, they’ll come away either feeling like Magic was pretty boring or like the truth was pretty boring."
The Morning Show,0,The Morning Show once again fails to provide its stellar cast with compelling storylines or complex character development.
Weeds,0,Almost completely misses.
Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,0,There's nothing Ashley Zukerman could have done to make Robert Landgon less of a butthead; his insufferability is a problem with the writing of the show.
What If...?,0,"While my curiosity is piqued, I wasn't completely blown away by this outing."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"The most prescient thing this version of The Mosquito Coast has to say about capitalism is how quickly it morphs into a knockoff of Breaking Bad and Ozark, repackaging a primetime TV template to bring an old story to a new audience."
Halo,0,"Those of us who don’t recognise every re-enacted power-up bleep and helmet-cam vision of destruction will probably find ourselves wondering, much of the time, quite what is going on."
The First Lady,0,"You will find no objections from me to giving each of these real women a chance to fill a whole series with their dualities, tensions, and complications. But there’s very little of that realness here."
The Stand,0,"As rendered in this iteration of King's epic, that mix of realism and fantasy results in a disjointed, tonally inconsistent work that manages to both over-condense aspects of the original saga and overstay its welcome."
Hawkeye,0,"Even a show that approaches its episodic run like an extra-long movie owes the audience a bit more momentum than this, especially when those installments roll out weekly."
Suspicion,0,"Based on the Israeli series False Flag, the show devolves into a strange hybrid that’s neither tense nor particularly logical."
Mare of Easttown,0,"More than halfway through the series, there's barely any momentum to the mystery, and the relationship drama is sprawling and unfocused."
Rise,0,"... Rise feels like a rehash, a collection of stories we've already seen, presented with a slightly darker palette."
Loot,0,"Not every show about the ultra-wealthy needs to be as biting as Succession, but Loot too often comes off as entirely toothless."
A Wilderness of Error,0,"A Wilderness of Error is a fascinating and informative look at a notorious piece of American history, but it struggles to defend its own relevance."
Lisey's Story,0,This show is hellbent on driving me mad thanks to one of its biggest stumbling blocks: the absence of any sort of logic to this universe.
The Stand,0,"Sadly there is very seldom any notion of stakes, of consequence, or of danger in this ultimately lifeless adaptation."
Bridgerton,0,"82 million Netflix account holders can’t be wrong, can they? Well, yes. Yes, they can."
Halo,0,"iHaloi looks a lot like well you might expect an adaptation of the game would, but it fails to distinguish itself from similar sci-fi fare."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"Even though he was a compelling scene-stealer in Daredevil, Frank Castle/The Punisher has never felt quite right in his own show. Season two will do little to change that impression."
The Wheel of Time,0,Will The Wheel of Time be a hit? Don't ask me. All I know is that I went into a kind of death spiral after watching the first episode.
The Offer,0,"Viewers would be better off watching the Godfather saga, as its a better use of their time  and its far more entertaining than the entirety of this series."
Altered Carbon,0,"It had good moments, it had bad moments, it had dull moments. I kind of wish now that there was just Season 1 standing alone as a great example of the genre..."
Battlestar Galactica,0,A lot of basic and mundane things don't add up for me.
True Blood,0,"In its final season, the series seems to have exhausted its stores of surprises."
Waco,0,The boilerplate exposition feels stilted and someone needs to get Shannon a cup of coffee.
Landscapers,0,"Every bit of this story is as weird as hell. The trouble is that, on screen, weirdness itself doesn't really give you very far to go."
Entourage,0,"Everything that went down on screen in this finale felt rushed, it was almost like no one bothered to tell the writers that they only had eight episodes this season and once they realised they had to squash episodes worth of material in to one half hour."
The First Lady,0,"There's never quite enough from any one first lady, which leaves a sense of disappointment. It's unfortunately a show that is lesser than the sum of its Emmy- and Oscar-winning parts."
The Stand,0,"If you don't stand for something, you end up looking like a Walking Dead spin-off that never made it to the air."
How I Met Your Mother,0,This finale seems to completely sour the show's legacy - something that is not more important than ever.
The Undoing,0,"Indeed, the show seems to relish the disorder that the Frasers cause in other people's lives, the pain they mete out. Throughout it all, the family remains static: glamorous, somehow still in control."
Brave New World,0,"It's not an immediately gripping techno-satire, nor a mindbending puzzle box. It's not an impressive sci-fi world, nor a bold piece of sex-violence-profanity prestige. It's just a disappointing adaptation trying to be everything for everyone."
Hellbound,0,An expendable attempt at a horror series that doesn't stand out. [Full review in Spanish]
Marvel's Agent Carter,0,"Get past the surface, though, and it once again looks as if the show has been relegated to the role of little more than handsome placeholder to break up SHIELD's season - all dressed up, perhaps, but as outfitted, with no real place to go."
Arrested Development,0,No programme is more infuriatingly chuffed with itself.
Line of Duty,0,"As we embark on series six, a far greater problem is the weight of the past. As the plot races on, names and events float to the surface of my consciousness like something disturbing in a canal."
Shining Girls,0,"Moss is obviously a draw, but even she can only do so much with thin and confusing material."
The Mist,0,"Okay, it's possible I'm overreacting here just a smidge. But Spike's version of The Mist is one dumb piece of work."
True Blood,0,Although the series could have continued - maybe by introducing zombies or mummies - True Blood had nowhere to go but in circles. It was time to put a stake in it.
Inventing Anna,0,"There is a brilliant drama to be had from the story of Anna Delvey, and when someone makes one I’ll be sure to let you know."
Invasion,0,"Perhaps it's simply that I've watched Independence Day too many times, but there's nothing about this show that's even particularly enjoyable, let alone fun."
Moon Knight,0,"...audiences that are looking for a unique and dynamic approach to one of the more unorthodox heroes in Marvels repertoire, Moon Knight is a disappointment."
The Affair,0,The Affair Season 5 Episode 1 was a colossal waste of time.
Bodyguard,0,"Unfortunately, full of filler where there should be thriller, Bodyguard just can't get the job done, literally or figuratively."
The Bletchley Circle,0,"Instead of stroking suspense, the show starts and stops in fits, never finding a thrilling stride that unites the mysteries and deepens characterizations. Let's hope that Anna isn't on a permanent vacation."
Earth to Ned,0,Alien puppet talk show falls short of Muppet expectations.
Amazing Stories,0,"This show should have been a home run. In my opinion the missed opportunity lies in three areas: the story, the pacing and the direction."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"Towards the end there was a 50-50 split between good and bad, but the first half or the show there was barely anything to like. A sad end for the Netflix MCU branch."
Rise,0,It's time for a break from the tears. You have to earn those.
The Afterparty,0,"The Afterparty squanders the talents of its cast with a broad, derivative and annoyingly obnoxious screenplay."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"Unless Alice and her rabbit pal have more tricks up their sleeve than Snow White and the gang could muster, ABC's visit to Wonderland might once again leave the network less in need of a looking glass than a rear-view mirror."
The Undoing,0,"The Undoing has an intriguing mystery at its core, and a wonderful ensemble, but questionable structural choices give the series an odd ""stop and go"" feeling, padding it out to its lengthy runtime of 332 minutes."
Bridgerton,0,"82 million Netflix account holders can’t be wrong, can they? Well, yes. Yes, they can."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,It is like I've gone to therapy on a Gwyneth Paltrow GOOP retreat... I feel like I have to go to therapy after suffering through.
The Me You Can't See,0,"As an exploration of trauma and mental health, however - and one that features testimonials from figures such as Lady Gaga and Glenn Close - it's frustratingly unambitious."
Turner & Hooch,0,It's fitting that McG would direct the Turner and Hooch pilot because it's about as inoffensive and bland as most of the director's output.
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"The real star of this woeful, pointless television programme is its toxic gender and sexual politics."
Lost,0,Does this mean all of Lost counts for nothing? It's another question I can't answer.
Arrested Development,0,"The more you know about what's happened with Tambor over the past 12 months and the cast's attempt to reframe it, the emptier the comedy's absurdist spectacle becomes."
The O.C.,0,"Its peculiar mix of comic adult misbehavior, teen love and sexuality and sarcastic humor -- all played to a trendy musical soundtrack -- returns for a fourth season that illustrates it has stayed at the party too long."
Ginny & Georgia,0,"If the writers trimmed away one or two, the mother-daughter tension at its core could shine. But with so much going on, that dynamic gets lost."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,0,"You can violate the laws of the universe you created, using a raft of new characters in whom we have no investment, or you can drag nine episodes' worth of doing so over 22 hours of TV. Not both."
The Nevers,0,"The Nevers is an unimpressive monument to a storyteller whose work has meant a lot to many people, but who cannot now figure out how to rise to the moment."
Big Little Lies,0,"The series works best when it focuses on intimate, human moments rather than on broad social critiques."
24,0,"Despite the high-grade action, the premiere is more a showcase for everything that was bad about 24 than a reminder of everything that was good."
Mr. Corman,0,Spending five-plus hours watching a very average man inch toward slightly greater self-awareness doesn't make for the most powerful TV experience.
WeCrashed,0,"There is little here that is enjoyable to watch and even less that is entertaining, and spending eight hours with the versions of these people portrayed by Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway is a punishment."
Little Voice,0,Never tries something original when a cliché will do instead.
Ginny & Georgia,0,"If the writers trimmed away one or two, the mother-daughter tension at its core could shine. But with so much going on, that dynamic gets lost."
Defending Jacob,0,"The result is imitation-flavored television - a chronic occurrence, six months after the streaming service's launch. There's a larger mystery there, and someone needs to solve it."
Moon Knight,0,"The rickety action sequences, paired with questionable CGI, drippy horror, terrible jokes, a shoddily assembled mystery and one too many rounds of over-the-top violence combine to make Moon Knight an unfortunate dud on the Marvel roster."
The Undoing,0,"While beautiful to look at, the show struggles to say something compelling as it's more interested in amplifying the melodrama instead of delving deep into its more interesting subjects."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"The storylines are byzantine, but they are not complicated. There is also no shortage of weary, heavy-handed platitudes, like fortune cookies that exclusively quote Bob Segar songs."
The Undoing,0,The real disappointment lies in the degree to which The Undoing shows itself to be simply a cheesy thriller.
Night Sky,0,Watch the first episode of Night Sky and you’ll have found your new favourite show. Carry on for another seven and you’ll wish you stopped a lot earlier.
The Wheel of Time,0,"While there is enough violence and faux-mysticism to keep genre fans happy, convincing human interactions are harder to find."
The Right Stuff,0,"Approach it simply as Hunky Young Astronauts in Love rather than a Wolfe adaptation... like the movie, it still can't find time to dedicate a full episode to NASA's test monkeys - and you might even be able to dispense with some of the disappointment."
WeCrashed,0,Apple TV's first high-profile letdown doesn't know whether to satirise WeWork founder Adam Neumann or to idolise him.
The Right Stuff,0,The story crawls along incrementally without using all that time to let us know its characters as anything but the broadest of archetypes.
Midnight Mass,0,The final scene was so nauseatingly mawkish I had to hide behind the sofa screaming to be put out of my misery.
The Shrink Next Door,0,"Maybe a different creative team could've done a better job adapting The Shrink Next Door, or maybe Marty Markowitz's story simply didn't need to be retold."
The Wheel of Time,0,"With a deficit of whimsy and wonder, ""Wheel"" introduces such thinly developed characters that it makes it hard to care (or see) who survives a chaotically filmed attack by monstrous orcs (sorry, trollocs)."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,This could have been eight episodes.
True Detective,0,"A thin story spread over a lot of hours, but Ali is excellent and so is his support."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,0,"By the time of its seventh and final season, there was a feeling that many of the cast just wanted it all to be over - something unfortunately reflected in the performances."
The Fall,0,"This show thinks it is Very Important Viewing, unmissable drama, televisual literature. The fact is it's very missable indeed."
The O.C.,0,"Too ironic to be a soap, but too soapy to be a parody. Take this season's dismal debut: a clunky, dark hour in which hunky Ryan brooded... He should have mourned instead the loss of the show's last, best quality-an ability to make fun of itself."
Gossip Girl,0,"With age comes wisdom? Whoever said that should have passed the memo to the Gossip Girl gang, because after six seasons, they're still as clueless as ever."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"There is too much time to fill, too many episodes to stretch a fairly thin plot across, and too many goddamn strangers to stay interested in any one of them."
True Detective,0,"True Detective Season 3 is a little more workmanlike and less baroque, perhaps too eager to prove that it can tell a legible story again."
Rise,0,"The problem is, even with its many storylines, Rise's attempt at making the viewer a part of this small town's community, it is just too prescribed."
His Dark Materials,0,With so much time taken up with gabbing there was little left for the kind of spectacle that made the first series a hit.
The Right Stuff,0,"Approach it simply as Hunky Young Astronauts in Love rather than a Wolfe adaptation... like the movie, it still can't find time to dedicate a full episode to NASA's test monkeys - and you might even be able to dispense with some of the disappointment."
Black Mirror,0,"Brooker still has the teeth - and the imagination to craft tales that link into our techno-paranoia, showing us a world gone wrong where we are not too careful - but the bite is somewhat lacking."
What If...?,0,"What If...? opens up a world of possibility for Marvel, which it explores with enthusiasm, but also, in an act of hubris, with one hand tied smirkingly behind its back."
The Afterparty,0,"An Apple TV+ comedy series with one murder, plenty of suspects and minimal intrigue -- the sort of show that's modestly entertaining but doesn't bring enough to the party."
Elite,0,"By its new fifth season, Élite finally arrives at the point where it can no longer pull off its gimmicks."
Big Little Lies,0,"The new episodes flirted with exploring the effects of trauma, but the writers shrugged when it came to finding a deeper meaning to suffering than that it simply sucks."
The Morning Show,0,It's clear that whoever is writing the loaded conversations between these characters has never participated in one of their own to learn that this is simply not how we talk about any of it.
True Detective,0,True Detective falls prey to a slightly milder case of misogyny than afflicted it in season one.
Limitless,0,"Maybe the show will improve when it kicks into the case-of-the-week format and ramps up the nonsensical effects of this mysterious pill, but I don't have high hopes."
Succession,0,"I come not to bury ""Succession"" nor to praise it, but to perpetually hope it will take up that messy space between paranoia and performative nonchalance."
Invasion,0,"Unfortunately, Invasion also borrows The Walking Deads molasses-like pace, without any of the payoff or precise characterization. The first season builds to a climax, sure, but its a story that lacks depth throughout."
The Nevers,0,As creaky as these first four episodes are - reams of exposition alternating between soap-opera twists and cutesy inventions like Penance's li'l electric car - I want to believe there are glimmers of promise.
Behind Her Eyes,0,"Behind Her Eyes just doesn't know what it wants to be and takes itself far too seriously, resulting in a muddled mess that could - and should - have been cut short."
Bel-Air,0,It takes every aspect of the original show and sucks out the joy.
The Essex Serpent,0,"The pacing is slow, and rather than feeling meditative or breathable, The Essex Serpent only feels mechanical, ploddingly carrying the plot forward scene to scene. Whatever electricity the leads’ performances could have lent it is thoroughly deadened."
Doctor Who,0,Legend of the Sea Devils was quite disappointing. I appreciated the fresh scenery and all-Asian guest cast but the Sea Devils fell flat mostly due to poor directing taking all the excitement away from their fight scenes.
The Pentaverate,0,"If you're not bowled over by the eight rubbery faces Myers cycle through its six episodes, maybe it's because they're only slightly removed from versions of his characters you've laughed with before but whose humor feels crustily outdated in 2022."
Angelyne,0,I liked “Angelyne” better as it went on... without ever being wholly convinced that it was a trip I needed to take.
The Haunting of Hill House,0,"Things were going so well. Now here I am, out back in the cold of night, burying it."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,The Time Traveler’s Wife should probably have been left in the past.
Deadwood,0,It's like saddling up and putting the spurs to a drunk Shetland pony.
Dr. Brain,0,"It does go some way to fulfilling it prophecy in terms of jump scares, eerie underground car parks and ominous shadows, but is let down by a plot which requires Cliffs Notes."
Girls,0,"Girls was insistently offbeat, and in defiance of TV convention, a character study more than an ensemble piece - even if it wasn't quite willing to admit that."
Foundation,0,"Spanning a millennium and juggling at least half-a-dozen narratives at any given moment, Foundation is suitably epic to behold, but has the emotional intensity of a lecture on particle physics."
Y: The Last Man,0,"While some intriguing & important new elements are added, like Elliot Fletcher's trans character, the show is so concerned with big ideas it neglects all of its characters."
The Alienist,0,"""The Alienist"" - which was originally critiqued for feeling behind the times and overly familiar - still plays like the worse version of so many other dramas."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,0,"It's a noble ambition, but one that surely Stewart must realize precious few viewers will stick around for without some jokes to leaven the proceedings."
Pretty Little Liars,0,"In its seventh season, Pretty Little Liars illustrates the dangers of stretching a mystery as far as it can go with a splashy premiere that fails to establish real stakes for its characters."
Y: The Last Man,0,"t takes the swashbuckling, humorous tone of the source material and trades it in for a generic end-of-the-world ominousness that makes it seem like a forgotten season of The Walking Dead."
Bel-Air,0,"Bel-Air is a glossy, expensive-looking soap that, like Fox’s Our Kind of People, puts the spotlight on uber-wealthy Black families. But “fresh?” Not so much."
The Right Stuff,0,"The Right Stuff is not bad, or even boring, just thin and unconvincing."
Prison Break,0,This was most definitely not the way I wanted nor expected season five to get underway. But here's hoping somehow the show is able to catch its footing because Ogygia was a complete and utter letdown.
Once Upon a Time,0,Once Upon a Time's magic is gone.
The Flight Attendant,0,"The writing is an insult to the acting caliber of all involved, especially the usually wonderful Zosia Mamet and new cast member Shohreh Aghdashloo."
And Just Like That...,0,There were many inclusivity themes as a lunge for relevance that only make you remember how funny and risky the un-PC Samantha could have made it.
Safe,0,"Safe could have been so good. All the ingredients were there for a prime binge-worthy crime thriller - the writers, the cast, the concept - but it just hasn't been given the time, care and attention it needed."
13 Reasons Why,0,This show has no business being a full hour long. And it certainly has no business leaving us with an hour-and-36-minute (!) series finale.
True Blood,0,"I won't go so far as to say that True Blood's limping into its final season, but it's definitely anemic."
The Wheel of Time,0,It all feels somewhat conventional. Is it the show's fault or because many fantasy film and television adaptations have already been made? [Full review in Spanish]
Vikings: Valhalla,0,"One beard only has to look at another beard and that’s it, throat slit. This has, in short, not been approached with any wit or humour or cleverness."
Safe,0,"[Michael C.] Hall's accent, reasonably consistent and yet rarely believable, is one of many things on Safe that are askew and, the more I think about it, the more I can't tell if it's intentional if not particularly satisfying, or merely bad."
Twin Peaks,0,Lynch's twisted brutalization of women likewise continues... It all seems to be part of the director's basic playbook. And it's past time for him to be called out on it.
Watchmen,0,"Lindelof keeps scribbling in the margins, adding in more and more story that may yet pay off but that takes perhaps undue patience in the interim."
True Detective,0,"The season had its moments, but it felt more like a vehicle for delivering a type of experience than a discrete story divided into eight installments. What's good about this show is almost entirely eclipsed by what doesn't work."
BoJack Horseman,0,[T]he decision to split up the sixth and final season makes these episodes a deeply unsatisfying experience.
Black Mirror,0,"Such dissonance underscores the impression, supported by the occasional but conspicuous Britishisms that issue from the mouths of American characters in the Netflix seasons, that Brooker isn't getting enough feedback on his scripts."
The Afterparty,0,"If this is the future of television, pass me the bottle."
House of Cards,0,"It sounds like a compelling story, but Claire remains an icy, tough-to-read cipher through much of it, despite flashbacks to her childhood and that fourth-wall-breaking, talking-to-the-viewers thing that Spacey once did so well."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"[Krysten] Ritter, who took such fantastic ownership of this character, deserves more than a season that finds Jessica more or less where it always does-let down by those around her."
WeCrashed,0,"WeCrashed establishes that shameless hustlers worth billions, even when played by Academy Award winning movie stars, are not necessarily interesting people."
Bridgerton,0,"The show tries to tack on more substantive themes, while still ignoring the ways that its world-building has come up short."
The Endgame,0,It's laughable rather than intimidating.
Sweet Tooth,0,"It seems unfair to call a drama about a ruined world a mess, but this feels, quite deliberately, all over the place."
The Endgame,0,It's laughable rather than intimidating.
Ozark,0,The final episodes were just awful. Everything that kept me from really bonding with the series about a family breaking bad was on display in those last hours.
The First,0,"Well shot, at times edited like an inspiring Super Bowl ad, the show falls into a curious trap of pretension. It seeks to be a ""serious"" show using astronauts, instead of being a good show about the potential of space travel."
The Flight Attendant,0,"I never understood the appeal of The Flight Attendant, and I still don't."
The First Lady,0,"While it celebrates women who break the mold, the show itself is deeply — and dispiritingly — conventional."
Losing Alice,0,"Despite the interesting way Alice and Sophie play off each other in the first two episodes, their interactions and the show as a whole has increasingly diminishing returns."
What If...?,0,"The light fun of it is eaten away by the cynicism from within the project, that what purports to be about infinite possibilities is blatantly more about repurposing."
Glee,0,Perhaps Ryan Murphy's most ruinous decision was to go all-out in his embrace of victimhood.
Pieces of Her,0,"Slick enough to keep a viewer from turning off Netflix’s autoplay feature, but too broad and detached to generate much in the way of insight or emotional connection, Pieces of Her struggles to locate a beating human heart at the center of its mystery."
Game of Thrones,0,"SHOCKING things happened just because they had shock value. They bore no connection to anything else that had happened before them. There was hardly any organic, believable storytelling leading up to those moments. Thus, they felt shallow."
Invasion,0,Invasion is an admirable attempt at subverting the expectations that come with a big budget sci-fi show about alien invaders; the only problem is that it's not very interesting or exciting.
House of Cards,0,Season six is a web with no spider at the centre.
The Undoing,0,The real disappointment lies in the degree to which The Undoing shows itself to be simply a cheesy thriller.
The Good Wife,0,"""End"" had moments that worked but never came together on the whole."
Star Trek: Voyager,0,"Everyone on Voyager deserved better, especially Kathryn Janeway."
His Dark Materials,0,With so much time taken up with gabbing there was little left for the kind of spectacle that made the first series a hit.
Moon Knight,0,A series that ultimately feels rushed.
Bodyguard,0,"Unfortunately, full of filler where there should be thriller, Bodyguard just can't get the job done, literally or figuratively."
The O.C.,0,"As is perhaps fitting, though, for a show about teenagers and their notoriously short attention spans, the writers found it hard to keep up the momentum and the quality took a dive... It has been clear the show is on its last legs."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"On the whole, the series' inability to decide whether to play things straight or lean into the Ferrell and Rudd reunion makes it hard to get used to anything that's happening."
Dr. Brain,0,"For a show with a wild central premise and a goofily brazen title, nothing here rises to the level of wildness that the show is teasing, nor is there the sort of grounding that could work as an alternative."
Prison Break,0,"Once the thrill of becoming reacquainted wears off, you're left with a somewhat muddled, not at all credible yarn."
11.22.63,0,"11.22.63 sets forth with a fascinating premise, but gets a little too distracted by superfluous material that only causes it to get sidetracked from the main plot, resulting in a slightly unfocused show with problematic execution."
Treadstone,0,Treadstone... just treads a lot of narrative water.
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Little fires will quickly merge into an overwhelming flame, and even though this is the first scene of the series, Hulu's adaptation goes right ahead and burns itself out."
Invasion,0,Invasion is an admirable attempt at subverting the expectations that come with a big budget sci-fi show about alien invaders; the only problem is that it's not very interesting or exciting.
Killing Eve,0,Comer and Oh do their damnedest to save scripts that appear to have a surface-level engagement with the central conflicts of the series.
Foundation,0,"I find myself less enthusiastic about spending hours watching a series gear up for the good stuff, especially when the material is as sombre as this."
Wolverine and the X-Men,0,"Blame whatever you like- the blatant Wolverine pandering, the departure from tradition- but the interest just wasn't enough to continue the story."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,0,"Game Changers just shrugs that if the Mighty Ducks' strategy worked for three movies, it'll simply work again here."
Invasion,0,"""Invasion"" always feels like it's using each far-flung story as a checklist."
Limitless,0,"Yet while Limitless is competently executed, what it lacks, finally, is any spark of inspiration. And alas, there's no pill for that."
The Big Bang Theory,0,"However big a role pop culture may have played in its stories, the show itself could never have served as a barometer for the rest of pop culture. It's impossible to be a meaningful barometer if the dial only ever reads one thing."
WandaVision,0,"The first three-ish episodes were very fun, and then it pretty quickly turned into a long Marvel movie."
The First,0,"The First begins as a space exploration drama on its way to Mars, but the show, like the mission it depicts, never quite lifts off the ground."
Forever,0,"It's like a mild-mannered reporter with a secret identity, but the secret identity is a mild-mannered marketing guy. The show sounds mysterious and alluring, until you know what it's hiding."
Mad Men,0,Each season is starting to resemble an animated cartoon where the same landscape rolls by over and over again. We've seen a lot of these story lines before.
Mare of Easttown,0,"Winslet is good in this ""Broadchurch''-meets-""The Killing""-meets-""True Detective""-meets-""Top of the Lake."" Otherwise, same-old-same-old."
Behind Her Eyes,0,"Although it retains the book's shocking twist (it was marketed with its own hashtag #WTFThatEnding), even that is not enough to give Behind Her Eyes an edge over its umpteen counterparts."
The Nevers,0,The Nevers begins with an intriguing premise and develops it in such a plodding way that interest progressively fades with each successive hour.
Bridgerton,0,"The real scandal of Bridgerton: Try as it might, it’s no substitute for Jane Austen."
The Twilight Zone,0,"As with most anthology series, the results are decidedly mixed. For one thing, the show does away with its social justice bent entirely at a time in which those stories would be most welcome."
The Thing About Pam,0,The Thing About Pam offers an intriguing but tonally off-putting rehash of a familiar true crime story.
Coyote,0,To be blunt: a show that asks its audience to connect to a rogue Border Patrol agent with literal blood on his hands needs to work harder than this one does to justify its premise.
Inventing Anna,0,The result falls flat. Inventing Anna is a stretched-out nine-episode romp that never quite catches the enigma of its protagonist -- or matches her appeal.
Limitless,0,"Maybe the show will improve when it kicks into the case-of-the-week format and ramps up the nonsensical effects of this mysterious pill, but I don't have high hopes."
The Nevers,0,"The Nevers is an unimpressive monument to a storyteller whose work has meant a lot to many people, but who cannot now figure out how to rise to the moment."
Joe vs Carole,0,"The series doesn’t know exactly what tone it wants to take. It kinda wants to be camp, but it kinda wants to be taken seriously, it kinda wants to give you just the facts ma’am, but it also kind of wants to show you different sides of these characters."
Defending Jacob,0,Perhaps the biggest crime committed in Defending Jacob is that the elements to make this series pop are all there; they just weren't executed properly.
Rise,0,"Mr. Radnor is not convincing -- or he is, but in the wrong ways."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Despite able performers and potent themes, the show is so addicted to chaos that it squanders its chance to say anything substantive."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Only one person in this fiasco is any good: the ever-brilliant Joshua McGuire, as Chris Clarke, a Downing Street communications chief."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Though the show repeats the same mistakes as Marvel's other Netflix series, those problems are magnified because the show lacks a compelling lead."
RENO 911!,0,"Unfortunately, that same sense of nostalgic comfort is also the show's greatest weakness; for better and for worse, the show (and its sense of humor) hasn't changed a whit since it went off the air in 2009."
Turner & Hooch,0,It's fitting that McG would direct the Turner and Hooch pilot because it's about as inoffensive and bland as most of the director's output.
Suspicion,0,"By the time Suspicion reaches its heavy-handed conclusion, we hardly care who done it and why they did it."
The Morning Show,0,"Too often, The Morning Show's second season is satisfied with the easiness of shock -- of announcing itself, though not communicating much of note, in a blare."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"The Punisher was a fun but undeniably flawed series, representative of the Netflix-Marvel universe as a model of frustrating inconsistency."
11.22.63,0,"11.22.63 sets forth with a fascinating premise, but gets a little too distracted by superfluous material that only causes it to get sidetracked from the main plot, resulting in a slightly unfocused show with problematic execution."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,Nine Perfect Strangers boasts a wonderful cast that is sadly under-utilised within a series lacking both plot content and atmosphere. We wish we were seeing something on whatever wavelength Nicole Kidman's performance is on.
The First,0,"For a show about people looking up to the stars in wonder, its gaze is disappointingly earthbound."
The Pentaverate,0,"Returning to the prosthetics and puns that helped make Austin Powers a classic was an inherent risk, but it might have been worth it with better writing."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,0,The Man Who Fell to Earth is like the worst kind of tech bro -- it doesn’t offer anything innovative enough to actually live up to its own hype.
The Offer,0,"This program insists that movies are important, and does so by pulping perhaps the most celebrated film of the second half of the twentieth century and using it as fuel for a diverting but hardly cinematic streaming series."
Hellbound,0,An expendable attempt at a horror series that doesn't stand out. [Full review in Spanish]
Legion,0,"I responded to moments of Legion because I vibed with its project, but all of the aspects of that project ended up working better in other shows."
Bel-Air,0,"Suck all the joy, exuberance and wondrous charisma out of “The Fresh Prince” — a worthy launchpad for an actor who, in his prime, was widely considered the biggest movie star in the world — and you’re left with the gloomy and plodding “Bel-Air.”"
Turner & Hooch,0,"Turner & Hooch could deliver a solid family dramedy or a mindless action-comedy; by trying to be both, the show ends up neither."
Brave New World,0,Brave New World has too many parts out of place to be a success - and stripped out one of the most important parts that would have made it a success.
The Undoing,0,"While beautiful to look at, the show struggles to say something compelling as it's more interested in amplifying the melodrama instead of delving deep into its more interesting subjects."
The Pentaverate,0,A profoundly unfunny series of sex and poop jokes.
Lovecraft Country,0,"There's something mechanical about Lovecraft Country's horror, both real and supernatural."
Sharp Objects,0,"It has everything to be a hit, but Sharp Objects does not captivate. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Lovecraft Country,0,"There's something mechanical about Lovecraft Country's horror, both real and supernatural."
Big Little Lies,0,"But by the end of season two of Big Little Lies, I not only didn't fully get what I wanted from it, I didn't feel like I got what I needed, either."
Money Heist: Korea - Joint Economic Area,0,"Basically, it reuses everything that gave personality to the [original] Spanish series and presents us with a copy instead of with an adaptation. [Full review in Spanish]"
Foundation,0,"For people who know or are fans of Isaac Asimov and his work, I feel compelled to warn you that if you watch the show you will see a scene so enraging that you will tear your TV in two with your bare hands."
Black Mirror,0,"The fifth series of Black Mirror is comprised of episodes that feel less like the work of Brooker and more like thin, wanting knock-offs that were inspired by him."
Shameless,0,"I understand that Shameless continues to find Frank useful, but the results are never actually interesting, nor do they ever add up to anything."
Marvel's Agent Carter,0,It became... nothing more than a Hayley Atwell vehicle that let everything else from production value to narrative importance fall to the wayside if it meant the show's lead actress getting in just one extra spunky line of dialogue.
The Stand,0,"While it may sound as if this would be particularly frightening to watch right now, the truth is that this much-awaited series is a bit of an anti-climax."
Little Voice,0,The stakes are ludicrously low.
The Offer,0,"The Offer certainly didnt have Coppolas blessing, and I hope this wasnt the reason behind his problematic portrayalhe is shown not as an angsty New Hollywood artist, but as a comedic buffoon."
The Nevers,0,As creaky as these first four episodes are - reams of exposition alternating between soap-opera twists and cutesy inventions like Penance's li'l electric car - I want to believe there are glimmers of promise.
Gaslit,0,"The entire time I watched Gaslit, I ricocheted between thinking it was a thought-provoking series full of memorable performances and that it was a terrible series that too frequently felt like a Saturday Night Live skit."
And Just Like That...,0,A sequel that was dead on arrival...
Mr. Corman,0,"Mr. Corman is billed as a ""comedy,"" somehow, but it's missing the laughs. It seems to be going for cringe comedy, but we just end up cringing. I felt more sad watching it than anything."
Hawkeye,0,"""Hawkeye"" is too beholden to the larger MCU as a guiding narrative force and generic house style of filming to truly find its own voice..."
Normal People,0,"We were shown banal locations and left to guess what was going on in the characters' minds as they stumbled for words or stared out of windows. That can work in a novel, with its internal monologues, but not on television."
The Nevers,0,The Nevers begins with an intriguing premise and develops it in such a plodding way that interest progressively fades with each successive hour.
Brave New World,0,"The nine-part debut season feels like it's built on miscalculation atop miscalculation, but the gravest one is that the citizens of New London are effectively extraterrestrials."
The Undoing,0,"This should all be sexily entertaining, and even fun, with Kidman and Hugh Grant playing Grace and Jonathan, and Kelley supplying the banter they exchange around the townhouse kitchen island. And for one episode it is."
The Queen's Gambit,0,A glamorous Anya Taylor-Joy doesn't show the true cost of addiction - but rather a rose-tinted view of womanhood and paint-by-numbers redemption.
Killing Eve,0,I think most will be disappointed at how far from the first two seasons this series has gone and be thankful that they wont be dragging it out much longer.
The Baby,0,"It should be weird and captivating! Instead, The Baby meanders..."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,0,"There will surely be some watchable gags... but between the consistently uncertain run and a world that has seen such a substantial shift in mindset, it's safe to say that viewers are more than ready to say goodbye."
Defending Jacob,0,"This limited series strains for impact. But it's unserious about the aspects of its story that are genuinely potentially interesting, and sillier than one might have any reason to expect."
Amazing Stories,0,"The upside of any anthology series is the possibility that the next installment can completely turn things around with a brand-new tale. Still, if this is the show's best foot forward, it doesn't imply much optimism."
Lisey's Story,0,"The problem is that when it's this close to the heart, it can often be a case of not being able to see the wood from the trees."
Turner & Hooch,0,"Unfortunately, at least in these first three episodes, the show is too caught up in recreating the squabbles between Turner and Hooch over and over again in new scenarios."
Halo,0,"The derivative touches can't help but make the whole exercise feel generic, exhibiting a lot of hardware but not much creative spark."
Loki,0,"Loki feels too constrained, too stale, for a story about a wayward god of mischief. Too much exposition bogs down the script."
The Nevers,0,"The Nevers is a huge mess, which has both far too much going on yet is also crushingly stupefying. The only bright points were Donnelly and Skelly, who shared an irascible chemistry."
The O.C.,0,"Too ironic to be a soap, but too soapy to be a parody. Take this season's dismal debut: a clunky, dark hour in which hunky Ryan brooded... He should have mourned instead the loss of the show's last, best quality-an ability to make fun of itself."
The Essex Serpent,0,"The pacing is slow, and rather than feeling meditative or breathable, The Essex Serpent only feels mechanical, ploddingly carrying the plot forward scene to scene. Whatever electricity the leads’ performances could have lent it is thoroughly deadened."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"The fights lack any excitement, physically or emotionally. There are a couple of fights where it felt like a constant back and forth with a punch, block, repeat."
Godless,0,I was excited for it... I think I fell asleep within the first 10 minutes of it. It was so unbelievably boring.
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,0,"The show's attempt to individualize its protagonists largely reduces them to predictable, banal archetypes."
Suspicion,0,"Based on the Israeli series False Flag, the show devolves into a strange hybrid that’s neither tense nor particularly logical."
The Twilight Zone,0,All over the map... Rod Serling had overworked himself into a state of total burnout from which he would never fully recover.
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"[Krysten] Ritter, who took such fantastic ownership of this character, deserves more than a season that finds Jessica more or less where it always does-let down by those around her."
The Big Conn,0,"The Big Conn bites off plenty, and occasionally more than it should chew, distending its scope to the point that it loses sight of Conn, whose over-the-top brazenness is the most interesting aspect of this saga."
Ozark,0,"Yes, I watched the second half of the Netflix hit series’ final season, and no, it wasn’t good. And I say this as someone who used to like the show."
Brave New World,0,"The series looks gorgeous, and expensive, even if its sci-fi brutalist aesthetic is a bit generic. The performances are solid, too... Yet something is missing from the show's core... I struggled to get invested in this bunch."
Once Upon a Time,0,OUAT season seven suffers from the same anvil-ish dialogue it always has.
The Twilight Zone,0,All over the map... Rod Serling had overworked himself into a state of total burnout from which he would never fully recover.
Succession,0,"I come not to bury ""Succession"" nor to praise it, but to perpetually hope it will take up that messy space between paranoia and performative nonchalance."
Treadstone,0,"A show whose ambition to try to capture a world's worth of adventure seems, too often, like taking the easy way out from digging too deeply into story or character."
They Call Me Magic,0,"It's a story that could easily have been told within the confines of a traditional 90 minutes (or less), but the style nowadays is to stretch out the form in order to make it an event."
The Offer,0,"At 10 hours, the material is stretched absurdly thin, and it makes every flaw show."
Game of Thrones,0,"Season 8 doesn't feel like it was earned, with too little time dedicated to growing characters paired with a greater emphasis on rushing to major plot points, rather than proving to those of us watching how inevitable they were."
God's Favorite Idiot,0,"Falcone’s heart is clearly in the right place, but all his goodwill is undone by a narrative that is both too simple and overly convoluted, underdeveloped characters, and chintzy production design."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Hulu trotted out Little Fires Everywhere, an eight-part limited series that attempts to capture the sprawling nature of the source material, but ultimately fails."
Taboo,0,"This tale sometimes feels like what might have happened if Sweeney Todd went after the East India Company, but it's weighed down by less-than-thrilling characterization."
Prison Break,0,"Once the thrill of becoming reacquainted wears off, you're left with a somewhat muddled, not at all credible yarn."
The Nevers,0,"There are too many characters, too many high-stakes plotlines, and not enough explanation for how it all connects."
Bridgerton,0,...it’s difficult to imagine that Bridgerton will ever make quite the splash that the first season did without stars like Page who strike the perfect balance between steamy and silly...
Brave New World,0,"The nine-part debut season feels like it's built on miscalculation atop miscalculation, but the gravest one is that the citizens of New London are effectively extraterrestrials."
Invasion,0,Invasion is a slow burn that threatens to become simply slow.
Limitless,0,"By the time viewers spend 45 minutes learning the rules, or lack thereof, of this extraordinary universe, sticking around to see what comes next may be less appealing."
Alias Grace,0,"It's mostly restrained and respectable, with modest production values and uneven performances."
Foundation,0,"There is no saga too epic for a little levity, and here it might have made some of the characters more believable. It might even have made me want to wade through the complexity."
Earth to Ned,0,Alien puppet talk show falls short of Muppet expectations.
Wolf Like Me,0,"Wolf Like Me's supernatural elements are its weakest parts, delivered in wispy terms that make them indistinct and generic."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,Why borrow a classic if you're not going to do anything with it?
His Dark Materials,0,"[Though] it's timely and relevant in places, His Dark Materials season 2 can't shake off the feeling everything it attempts has been done better elsewhere before."
WandaVision,0,"It feels empty and aimless, like the writers wanted an avenue to play with the TV eras, but didn't think hard enough about how to make WandaVision independent of the past."
Invasion,0,It's nothing but a kitchen sink drama as people are running and seeing weird things happening.
Sex/Life,0,"The primary failing of Sex/Life is its inability to balance the acrobatic-romp and woman-finding-herself elements of its concept; there's so much of the former, and not enough of the latter."
Night Sky,0,More of an exercise in frustration than anything else.
A Wilderness of Error,0,Morris' book meticulously chronicled a wilderness of errors. All Smerling's documentary does is get lost in a wilderness of voices.
Sharp Objects,0,"""Sharp Objects"" should leave more of a mark."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"As it nears the end of its run, the series doesn't seem to have much more to say about trauma."
The First Lady,0,"With such powerhouse actors on set, its a shame that the series is a jumbled collection of moments that barely glance upon what makes these women so special."
Behind Her Eyes,0,Where others excel with the dark and twisty storylines building intrigue and frightening sequences this one is only good for mustering up a sleepy yawn.
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"This Iron Fist ain't immortal, he's got a real short shelf life."
The Pentaverate,0,"While I am glad I didn’t have to pay to see this on the big screen, I enjoyed laughing at some dumb jokes for a couple of hours."
Brave New World,0,"Welcome to this not-so Brave New World, where all the ideas feel old and not nearly as deeply considered as the creators think. But, hey, at least it all looks fabulous."
Behind Her Eyes,0,"The empty characterization isn't egregious, but it seems like an apparatus that's been built around some hidden central engine the show doesn't want to reveal. Why are these people like this?"
Little America,0,"Little America is muddled, with its baked-in politics directly in opposition to its ""positive"" message."
Amazing Stories,0,"The opening episode is a story, certainly, but it isn't remotely amazing. Steven Spielberg's revival of his Eighties anthology series has been keenly awaited by viewers of a certain vintage. They are doomed to be disappointed."
Inventing Anna,0,"Inventing Anna is a meandering and shallow take on Anna Sorokin's story, glacially paced with superfluous tangents that distract from the character we're really interested in."
Y: The Last Man,0,"The real undoing of Y: The Last Man... is that it takes itself too seriously to allow for many other emotions beyond ""desperate"" and ""grieving."""
The End of the F...ing World,0,Totally disappointing. [Full review in Spanish]
Invasion,0,Invasion proceeds so incrementally across such a wide range of characters and their responses to extraterrestrial terrorism that you might well lose your way from week to week. Never mind your interest.
Turner & Hooch,0,It's fitting that McG would direct the Turner and Hooch pilot because it's about as inoffensive and bland as most of the director's output.
The Mosquito Coast,0,"Fox's delusions grow to the point where it's sometimes hard to believe what's happening, and it makes less of a statement about consumerism and the dangers of a free market than it, as I said already, does the Walter White thing in a misfired manner"
Dave,0,"Dave is still a biting satire set within the music industry that depicts the many pitfalls of making it to the main stage at Coachella. But especially this season, it's sometimes difficult to watch."
Star Wars: Visions,0,"If ""Star Wars: Visions"" does nothing else, it at least tells the story that, if only in part it's an important part, that the long time ago and the galaxy far away was maybe the Tokugawa era in feudal Japan."
Hawkeye,0,"""Hawkeye"" is clearly more concerned with setting up Kate Bishop for future MCU phases than creating a problem worthy of two heroes' time. And at six hours, it's certainly not worthy of yours."
Marvel's Daredevil,0,Where does this go from here? Can Daredevil survive a fourth season? Or is it time for the character to hang up his horns for good?
Community,0,"The last season of Community was really, truly awful. I mean, it crashed and burned. And for a show as self-aware as this one, there's no way it didn't know it."
Arrested Development,0,"It's never a waste to follow the stories of these characters, but the experience is becoming increasingly hollow."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,0,"For a series dedicated to supposed historical realism, Downton Abbey wraps things up with a bow of pure fantasy."
The First Lady,0,"For all its glossy sheen and good intentions, The First Lady has little to offer that feels truly, meaningfully “real.”"
The Nevers,0,"The world-building, at least, is extensive, and it's possible later episodes might benefit from having carved out so much narrative real estate, so many competing interests. But these early episodes are crowded."
Chernobyl,0,Mazin name-checks most of the pertinent facts of the story. But his cheap theatrics... detract from the real tragedy of the story.
And Just Like That...,0,Ask not whether fans needed this reboot but why Parker and King wanted to go to all this trouble in the first place.
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"I'd watch these characters all day under the simplicity of a spotlight and a monologue, free from the pretentious packaging. It's a shame that the show seems to get hit with a tranquilizer dart after the first couple of episodes ..."
The First,0,"In the end The First feels much like Mars itself: cold, bumpy, and too far away to touch."
Turner & Hooch,0,"One difference between the film and the series - and it's a pretty significant one - is that Josh Peck is no Tom Hanks. Another difference - again, pretty significant - is that it's not 1989 anymore."
Vikings: Valhalla,0,"If youre just here to up the historical combat quotient in your screen diet, have at it. But dont expect much else."
Sex/Life,0,"Having watched all eight episodes of the show, what I remember from it isn't how steamy the sex scenes are (not least because they aren't), but how frustrating I found Billie and all of the people around her."
Safe,0,"Safe could have been so good. All the ingredients were there for a prime binge-worthy crime thriller - the writers, the cast, the concept - but it just hasn't been given the time, care and attention it needed."
The Endgame,0,"It all looks quite sleek and impressive, but even after just two episodes, Elena’s ability to pull off the impossible out of nowhere begins to get old."
Night Sky,0,"The show trips over its length -- Night Sky is built around a decent idea for a 100-minute movie, which it then stretches to eight hours."
13 Reasons Why,0,"Laves nothing to chance, wrapping up almost every major loose end in what is now surely the show's trademark: throw every possible hot button issue into a blender and mash the switch labeled ""the power of friendship and de-escalation"" until smooth."
Once Upon a Time,0,Once Upon a Time's magic is gone.
The Shrink Next Door,0,"I had the same uneasy reaction to the podcast itself, and I bailed on Shrink early, in both incarnations. But hey, there's obviously an audience for this."
Fargo,0,"Fargo has lost its footing in Season 4, succumbing to stylization and caricature and gratuitous over-plotting, and effectively wasting a tremendous cast. We're left with a weak story and a few banal monologues about race, money, and Life In America."
Sex/Life,0,"Sex/Life is billed as comedy drama. If it's funny, though, it's for all the wrong reasons."
The First Lady,0,"You will find no objections from me to giving each of these real women a chance to fill a whole series with their dualities, tensions, and complications. But there’s very little of that realness here."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"The series rapidly hops between decades but feels like it moves at a crawl, dulling the myriad charms of its leading cast."
Sharp Objects,0,Sharp Objects scratches the surface of being interesting but can't overcome its dull edges.
The Thing About Pam,0,The Thing About Pam offers an intriguing but tonally off-putting rehash of a familiar true crime story.
Waco,0,"Waco won't be the first drama to reduce a tragedy to its simplest components, but this doesn't offer much confidence that these are the right components or the only ones."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"If we could get high enough, maybe we could see some reason to sit through this Disneyfied pastiche of Lewis Carroll and ""1,001 Nights."" Or maybe not."
The Pentaverate,0,"Got some good laughs out of the first three episodes, but I grew weary."
The Pentaverate,0,"Got some good laughs out of the first three episodes, but I grew weary."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"[It] spends a great deal of time drip feeding epiphanies, dwelling in personal moments and dealing in character and yet there is a disconnect. Production design, cinematography and score all come together with direction and tone yet something is missing"
The Haunting of Hill House,0,"Like everything in Hill House, that terror gets muted, slowed down and picked over so much that it ends up banal and lifeless."
Star Wars: Visions,0,"While some episodes have good elements, overall it's just too uneven. It also doesn't feel enough like Star Wars. But kudos to Lucasfilm for trying something different."
Wolf Like Me,0,The first three episodes mildly intrigued me – but not enough to want to continue.
Man vs. Bee,0,"Despite its enticing if predictable premise, Man vs. Bee lacks a sting in its tail."
The Offer,0,"It deserves credit for elevating my overall esteem for The Godfather in one respect: At no point in all of my viewings of Coppola's epic was I ever moved to scream at random intervals, ""OH MY GOD, WHO CARES?"""
The Essex Serpent,0,"A decent production budget and starry cast led by Tom Hiddleston and Claire Danes are squandered on a dreary, convoluted, portentous drama with all the appeal of a fog blanket over a giant rotting fish which someone briefly mistook for a dead dragon."
Squid Game,0,"The greater anticapitalist critique of Squid Game almost entirely toothless following any serious analysis...I am unimpressed with the messaging, and am confident this drama won't stand the test of time."
Suspicion,0,"By the time Suspicion reaches its heavy-handed conclusion, we hardly care who done it and why they did it."
Mr. Corman,0,I wonder with Joseph Gordon-Levitt wearing too many creative hats that he's juggling too many ideas both with the storytelling and the creative vision to keep up emotional drive within the series.
Inventing Anna,0,"In the end, both the main characters remain somewhat opaque, because they’re defined less by their specific goals than by the nebulous act of wanting."
What If...?,0,"What If...? opens up a world of possibility for Marvel, which it explores with enthusiasm, but also, in an act of hubris, with one hand tied smirkingly behind its back."
The First,0,"Well shot, at times edited like an inspiring Super Bowl ad, the show falls into a curious trap of pretension. It seeks to be a ""serious"" show using astronauts, instead of being a good show about the potential of space travel."
The First Lady,0,"Ten episodes in, you don’t come away feeling you know the stories of these women any better, any deeper, than you already did."
Ozark,0,"More often than not, Ozarks double-crosses and shady dealings read like bullet points on a list the writers are running through, with no intrigue or connective tissue between them."
The Capture,0,"Offers a whiplash-inducing premiere that goes from, ""This is a ridiculous investigation that appears to lack a crime"" to ""How is that possible?""... A somewhat dubious premise."
WandaVision,0,It's like plugging through porridge for the chocolate button at the bottom of every bowl.
Twin Peaks,0,"""Twin Peaks"" still has the power to shock at times, but this is largely 217 characters (the number of actors in the new season) in search of an author."
The Gilded Age,0,Wharton is unlikely to have approved of such a half-hearted imitation of her work.
The Pentaverate,0,"Got some good laughs out of the first three episodes, but I grew weary."
The Offer,0,"At 10 hours, the material is stretched absurdly thin, and it makes every flaw show."
Big Little Lies,0,The flattening of previously full characters may be the biggest loss of this season.
All American,0,"I expected more from this show - do better, All American."
Star Trek,0,"It's just an unlikely space opera, overlong, clunkily put together and not the slightest bit amusing."
Outer Range,0,"Outer Range isn’t consistently satisfying as a drama series, though as an extended metaphor for television viewing circa 2022, this story of a Wyoming family throwing things in a mysterious hole on their ranch is at least unintentionally savvy."
Lisey's Story,0,"Lisey's Story has a strong cast and direction, but the writing ultimately sinks the series."
Shadow and Bone,0,"More exhausting than thrilling, Netflix's latest period fantasy adventure, ""Shadow and Bone,"" will have a tough time breaking out of the fan base already built by the books."
Arrested Development,0,"Arrested Development, which was once, easily, one of my favorite comedies of all time, has become a reanimated corpse that I'd like to see dead and buried."
A Teacher,0,It takes its sweet time getting anywhere and it's not an engaging trip. Both Ms. Mara and Mr. Robinson create characters who are sympathetic but also uninteresting; neither provides a reason to hang on.
Rise,0,"Mr. Radnor is not convincing -- or he is, but in the wrong ways."
The OA,0,Annoying. Gripping. But annoying.
The Afterparty,0,"If you're a fan of Haddish or anyone else involved, I'd recommend you look for your yuks elsewhere. Billed as a genre-defying murder mystery, the only thing this tone-deaf pastiche-fest defies is a reason to be seen."
The Nevers,0,There is a lot going on in The Nevers. The only thing it seems to lack is a point.
Raised by Wolves,0,"It’s a lot. A lot of weirdness that instead of being fed to us as mysteries for us to theorize about, or as simple pieces of a puzzle, they instead become seeds for further mystery-box tropes."
Once Upon a Time,0,Once Upon a Time's magic is gone.
Lovecraft Country,0,"Generally, television shows are better served by declining to handhold their audiences through various twists and turns. But Lovecraft moves straight past 'trust the audience' and runs right into 'the audience can read our minds.'"
Two and a Half Men,0,"Two and Half Men hit a new low every season and then continued to sink even further underground. During this last season, the show went off the rails in terms of absurdity and offensiveness."
Limitless,0,"Yet while Limitless is competently executed, what it lacks, finally, is any spark of inspiration. And alas, there's no pill for that."
Reacher,0,"Reacher hits all of the required beats of the story but never does it with a kinda of aplomb. There’s all the elements presented here, but there doesn’t seem to be much in the way of depth and the filmmaking leaves a lot to be desired."
The Thing About Pam,0,"A watchable if often underwhelming true crime docudrama that wants to both be weird and play it safe, ending up in a strange middle ground between the two."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"The dull courtroom sequences occasionally slip into stagey reconstructions of what happened between defendant and accused. At no point does Kelley’s series pause to consider what it is it’s trying to say about, um, well, anything."
Defending Jacob,0,"The result is imitation-flavored television - a chronic occurrence, six months after the streaming service's launch. There's a larger mystery there, and someone needs to solve it."
Brave New World,0,The idea of a society where pandemics have been completely eradicated may sound ideal in this particular moment. But that's the only attractive I could find in Brave New World's utopic setting. [Full Review in Spanish]
Bel-Air,0,It takes every aspect of the original show and sucks out the joy.
The First Lady,0,"The Showtime miniseries, starring Viola Davis, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Gillian Anderson, manages to make life as a White House wife seem both cosmic and forgettable."
Glee,0,"While the new kids at McKinley get a few quirky gags, they feel half-hearted, as if only real remaining mission is to follow our old friends to the finish line. That's fine. But we could have done it two seasons ago and not missed much."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,One crucial departure from the formula is the writing.
Inventing Anna,0,"As watchable as the show can be, one cant help but see the better version lurking beneath the surface. Ultimately, iInventing Annai misses the point of what made Delveys story a viral sensation."
Dr. Brain,0,"For a show with a wild central premise and a goofily brazen title, nothing here rises to the level of wildness that the show is teasing, nor is there the sort of grounding that could work as an alternative."
Lovecraft Country,0,"Lovecraft Country feels like a missed opportunity to repurpose the racist fear at the heart of Lovecraft's work to articulate the specific dread, isolation, and social death felt by Black people in all corners of the world."
Stranger Things,0,"In the end, it isn’t growing up that threatens the unstoppable rise of Netflix’s great homegrown hit. It’s a refusal to let go of what no longer serves it."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,It's all meant to be a paean to the imagination. Too bad the effects pry some of us out of our imaginations and into the tech lab.
The First,0,"Providing all the attendant pageantry and triumphant music and inspirational speeches you might expect, before shifting back to the glummest, slowest, least enthusiastic approach possible to the material."
Killing Eve,0,This one’s over. It’s done.
Star Trek: Enterprise,0,The most infuriating thing about Enterprise is the fact that it has always had some of the most potential of any of the Trek series and has always gone out of its way to squander every opportunity it has ever had to capitalize on that potential.
The Haunting of Hill House,0,"Most frustratingly, the adaptation abandons the raw feminine perversity that made Jackson's story so indelible."
Bridgerton,0,"82 million Netflix account holders can’t be wrong, can they? Well, yes. Yes, they can."
The First Lady,0,"You will find no objections from me to giving each of these real women a chance to fill a whole series with their dualities, tensions, and complications. But there’s very little of that realness here."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"The title, and the blueprints from other shows, seem disposable, or at least casually, even wastefully transposable. How predictably American, Allie Fox would probably think."
Behind Her Eyes,0,"Although it retains the book's shocking twist (it was marketed with its own hashtag #WTFThatEnding), even that is not enough to give Behind Her Eyes an edge over its umpteen counterparts."
Marvel's Daredevil,0,Where does this go from here? Can Daredevil survive a fourth season? Or is it time for the character to hang up his horns for good?
Foundation,0,"There is no saga too epic for a little levity, and here it might have made some of the characters more believable. It might even have made me want to wade through the complexity."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,0,The characterizations are beginning to get cartoonish.
Lost,0,Like the televisual equivalent of a keyboard-pounding poet... At least we know that we'll only have to suffer through one more season of this foolishness.
Godless,0,"In Godless, we see a black town, literally called Blackdom, and its inhabitants as ""others..."" Think that's bad? Native American characters do not do better"
Pretty Little Liars,0,"In its seventh season, Pretty Little Liars illustrates the dangers of stretching a mystery as far as it can go with a splashy premiere that fails to establish real stakes for its characters."
A Wilderness of Error,0,"A Wilderness of Error is a fascinating and informative look at a notorious piece of American history, but it struggles to defend its own relevance."
Bel-Air,0,"Painfully earnest and mostly stripped of its original buoyancy, this formerly amusing and entertaining fish-out-of-water story is left gasping for an original thought."
The Stand,0,"Unfortunately, the sabotage of the novel's truly enthralling story-telling leaves its ideology as its strongest element."
What If...?,0,"A galaxy-level cast, for a TikTok-level Disney+ series. [Marvel's] first animated series [...] allows it to operate on a different canvas [but] the first three episodes don't push the envelope. What If...? feels like a footnote in the MCU encyclopaedia."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,0,The series starts strong but its main character only grows thinner as the story progresses.
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,This season should have been appropriate titled Iron Fist Season 2: An SJW Redemption Story. AKA: We're sorry we tried to sell you a white dude doing kung fu because clearly only Asians can do that.
His Dark Materials,0,"It's hard to imagine any teenage fan of fantasy adventure, raised on Star Wars and superhero movies, sitting through even ten minutes of this coalescing sludge."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"Remembering Peter Weir's 1986 film, a descent-into-madness tragedy set entirely on the titular coast of Honduras, could be more of a hindrance to enjoying this new take."
Loot,0,"Because [Rudolph] can do almost anything, a temptation exists to create roles that allow her to do everything. And that can result in a tonal jumble like Loot, which feels like a lot of great raw material in search of a series to make sense of it all."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"Every time it feels as though the show might actually want to have a real conversation about fate, free will, or consequences, it slides away from the implication without ever fully looking it in the face."
Lisey's Story,0,Lisey's Story is a mess in almost every conceivable way.
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Though the show repeats the same mistakes as Marvel's other Netflix series, those problems are magnified because the show lacks a compelling lead."
Line of Duty,0,It all feels very much as if Line Of Duty is running out of energy and impetus. Six seasons is one too many.
Invasion,0,"Invasion doesn't appear to be all that interested in exploring, you know, the actual alien invasion bit of its plot - and that's a problem."
Night Sky,0,"Night Sky begins as a beautiful coming-of-old-age story, but it splinters into an overstuffed sci-fi thriller."
The Sex Lives of College Girls,0,"We've seen better depictions of college misadventures, and while most aren't as realistically inclusive as this one, neither are their mechanics as obvious."
House of Cards,0,"House of Cards...trashes itself, even if it was a sort of knowing trash to start with."
God's Favorite Idiot,0,"The series has a lot more high concept ambition and creativity than the husband-and-wife team’s previous collaborations like Tammy, but most of the laughs come from straightforward sitcom scenes of bickering co-workers."
Stranger Things,0,It feels both overstuffed and slackly paced at the same time.
Loot,0,"While it has plenty of funny moments, it’s a hard pill to swallow to muster much sympathy for a character that literally has everything she wants."
Loki,0,"It's interesting to think and write about-a show that's about control, order, chaos, and the unknowable notions of free will, determinism, and choice-but mildly entertaining, at best, as a whole."
Bridgerton,0,"Although it's hardly a failure, Bridgerton Season 2 suffers from too many extraneous storylines and not focusing enough on its leading two characters, and that's where it falls short."
Two and a Half Men,0,"I swear to God, I don't think I could come up with a worse ending."
Sex/Life,0,This epitomizes trash TV; it's a soapy melodrama that could be interpreted either as emotional or hilarious depending on the viewer's interpretation.
Bel-Air,0,Bel-Air strives for authenticity in the most thinly drawn manner possible.
The Wheel of Time,0,"Shows like The Wheel of Time feel reverse-engineered from an ideal outcome. And, unlike in fantasies, prophecies in the real world aren't guaranteed to come true..."
The Morning Show,0,"The plot became a haphazard mess, motivations were mysterious, no two storylines tied together, and the cast foundered. Saying it was off the rails was an insult to train derailments everywhere."
Gaslit,0,"Roberts simply feels miscast as Martha, to whom she bears no resemblance, physical or otherwise."
Arrested Development,0,"The meandering plot sucks the charm from everything. The characters feel oddly as though they don't get to exhibit or develop the traits we know them by, as they're usually too busy rattling off exposition."
The Offer,0,"The Offer certainly didnt have Coppolas blessing, and I hope this wasnt the reason behind his problematic portrayalhe is shown not as an angsty New Hollywood artist, but as a comedic buffoon."
A Wilderness of Error,0,Morris' book meticulously chronicled a wilderness of errors. All Smerling's documentary does is get lost in a wilderness of voices.
Lisey's Story,0,Lisey's Story is a mess in almost every conceivable way.
Suspicion,0,"Based on the Israeli series False Flag, the show devolves into a strange hybrid that’s neither tense nor particularly logical."
Entourage,0,"The show's best days are behind it, and the eighth-and-final-season curtain appears to be coming down none too soon."
God's Favorite Idiot,0,"Falcone’s heart is clearly in the right place, but all his goodwill is undone by a narrative that is both too simple and overly convoluted, underdeveloped characters, and chintzy production design."
The Fall,0,"For all its psychological, almost literary complexity, it loses much of its narrative steam. It's that great 21st-century phenomenon: a show that's more fun to think about than it is to watch."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"May get better on the long run but the ""Big Sky"" twist at the start does not bode well."
Sex/Life,0,"The primary failing of Sex/Life is its inability to balance the acrobatic-romp and woman-finding-herself elements of its concept; there's so much of the former, and not enough of the latter."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,0,"I... didn't really like this season. More clunkers than good episodes, but ""Chosen"" still stands as one of the best series finales I've ever seen."
Normal People,0,"We were shown banal locations and left to guess what was going on in the characters' minds as they stumbled for words or stared out of windows. That can work in a novel, with its internal monologues, but not on television."
Amazing Stories,0,"This show should have been a home run. In my opinion the missed opportunity lies in three areas: the story, the pacing and the direction."
The Thing About Pam,0,"A watchable if often underwhelming true crime docudrama that wants to both be weird and play it safe, ending up in a strange middle ground between the two."
Halo,0,"Schreiber is, indeed, the most interesting thing about Halo -- which isn’t necessarily saying all that much."
Killing Eve,0,Comer and Oh do their damnedest to save scripts that appear to have a surface-level engagement with the central conflicts of the series.
A Teacher,0,Lots of people have bad childhoods and boring spouses yet never end up becoming sexual predators. Where's the limited series about those people?
House of Cards,0,"Robin Wright was one of the best things from the previous seasons of House of Cards, but season 6 simple should've never existed. The ghost of Frank Underwood became its doom. Full review in Spanish"
Devs,0,"Garland's vision is in the forefront here, and the result is a limited series with a frosty emotional tone, and a story heavy on cutting-edge techno-speak, but skimpy when it comes to characterization."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Yet drastically improved action sequences...just aren't enough to salvage Iron Fist, let alone keep general audiences interested."
Mare of Easttown,0,"Winslet is good in this ""Broadchurch''-meets-""The Killing""-meets-""True Detective""-meets-""Top of the Lake."" Otherwise, same-old-same-old."
The Wilds,0,"Overall, The Wilds is a letdown. There are some wonderful moments featuring the girls throughout the 8 episodes, but mainly you mainly just find yourself wishing the whole thing was done differently."
Taboo,0,The series itself dives into bewildering sojourns through memory. . .or is it fantasy?. . . showing tribespeople with painted faces and bizarre asides in which James whispers in unfamiliar tongues to unseen forces.
All of Us Are Dead,0,"The series ultimately bites off more than it can chew in themes, characters, and ambition."
Dr. Brain,0,"For a show with a wild central premise and a goofily brazen title, nothing here rises to the level of wildness that the show is teasing, nor is there the sort of grounding that could work as an alternative."
Halo,0,"This adaptation offers a lot of explanations and fun effects but little else. Halo has the potential to be good time, but at least in its first episodes, it’s not quite there yet."
The O.C.,0,It's easy to deduce how the characters of The O.C. spent their summer vacation. They were practicing jumping the shark. They have it down perfectly.
The First Lady,0,"The message that these women overcame barriers is hammered home, so that their heroism is never in doubt, never challenged along the way. That’s no fun."
The Outsider,0,"""The Outsider"" takes an entertaining and propulsive, if routine, read and renders it with style and savvy but not much of a pulse."
Gossip Girl,0,"With age comes wisdom? Whoever said that should have passed the memo to the Gossip Girl gang, because after six seasons, they're still as clueless as ever."
What If...?,0,"The idea of taking such popular, well-worn characters and scrambling them throughout this massive worldbuilding experiment sounds fun, but the results so far are pretty lukewarm."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,Is to its audience kind of like Tranquillum House is to the group of troubled men and women who decide to stay there: a place that sounds like a great investment on paper but feels confusing and not quite what you expected once you arrive.
Invasion,0,"Take away the aliens, and what's left is essentially the sprawling network family drama series This Is Us."
1883,0,"For fans of westerns, 1883 certainly looks like the real deal, coming from Yellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan and featuring Sam Elliott as a gnarled cowboy. The execution, however, feels stale."
Invincible,0,"But both the jokes and the character beats that fuel Invincible are too sporadic to make the series feel anything more than sputtering. Unassailable, it is not."
Waco,0,"The only way the government could look any more like buffoons, barbarians, and jackasses in the series is if the ATF and FBI sequences were soundtracked with ""Yakety Sax."""
And Just Like That...,0,"Far too many 2021 cultural touchstones and new characters are awkwardly parachuted into the luscious looking Michael Patrick King executive produced revival of sorts, as if to check a box."
Hawkeye,0,"If you are very much plugged into the Marvel Universe, yes its a Must Watch. If youre not that bothered, then no."
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,"They try to cram so much into those episodes that even potentially interesting storylines turn into a slog, and Luke's journey goes from the understandably rage-filled chapter that we see in every hero's story to a chore."
The Endgame,0,"There are no visual ideas here, no narrative ideas and no core performances to keep you watching while waiting for those other attributes to emerge."
The Mist,0,There's room for interesting rehashes that bring new perspectives and ideas. The Mist is definitely not one of them.One adaptation was enough.
Pieces of Her,0,The latest example of a miniseries that long overstays its welcome.
Wolf Like Me,0,"Wolf Like Me's supernatural elements are its weakest parts, delivered in wispy terms that make them indistinct and generic."
Waco,0,The boilerplate exposition feels stilted and someone needs to get Shannon a cup of coffee.
The Wheel of Time,0,"The action, when it comes, is lively, if predictable, but The Wheel of Time buckles under chunks of tedious exposition."
Rise,0,"Rise wants to be an inspiring drama. More accurate to describe it as a drama about wanting to be inspirational...Rise seems uninterested in its own best instincts, willing to bring up ideas but unwilling to carry them over the finish line."
Behind Her Eyes,0,"The empty characterization isn't egregious, but it seems like an apparatus that's been built around some hidden central engine the show doesn't want to reveal. Why are these people like this?"
The Nevers,0,This weird mix of space and steampunk will confuse viewers rather than confound them.
The Mist,0,"Like King's last TV series, ""Under the Dome,"" ""The Mist"" would seem to have a short shelf life. One hour with these people and you'll be rooting for the critters."
And Just Like That...,0,"Far too many 2021 cultural touchstones and new characters are awkwardly parachuted into the luscious looking Michael Patrick King executive produced revival of sorts, as if to check a box."
Joe vs Carole,0,"It's never ideal to arrive way too late to the party, and Joe vs Carole feels guilty of that, adapting the story of Netflix's Tiger King, a.k.a. Joe Exotic, into a limited series that dutifully replicates those events without much bite."
Stranger Things,0,Stranger Things is still Stranger Things. It just now comes with astoundingly thick levels of padding.
Stranger Things,0,"Stranger Things 4 is a sad, indulgent, at-times-predictable slog. Episodes routinely run more than an hour and many characters are mopey."
Ozark,0,"The show enters its final seven episodes with a problem: How do you create credible foes and foils for the Byrde's in such a short amount of time?... These rivalries feel like temporary fixes, band-aids applied to a gaping head wound."
The Office,0,"There's some symmetry in the fact that after eight years, four Emmys, three regional managers, and an untold number of parties in the conference room, The Office's farewell feels more like an afterthought than an event."
Rise,0,"Welcome to NBC's Rise, a new series that suffers from some very significant pilot-itis."
11.22.63,0,"If Stephen King could go back in time, maybe he'd decide to stop selling his books to television."
Ginny & Georgia,0,"If the writers trimmed away one or two, the mother-daughter tension at its core could shine. But with so much going on, that dynamic gets lost."
Moon Knight,0,Moon Knight attempts to do something even more different in the MCU but it fails at every attempt.
Foundation,0,"I find myself less enthusiastic about spending hours watching a series gear up for the good stuff, especially when the material is as sombre as this."
The First,0,"It's too much buildup for too little payoff. By the time the series is ready to launch, we're already charting a course for somewhere else."
True Detective,0,Mahershala Ali is the most notable thing about this third season that desperately tries to imitate the first season. [Full Review in Spanish]
The Capture,0,"It's gripping up to a point, but really it's just you staring at a screen while watching another person staring at a screen."
BoJack Horseman,0,[T]he decision to split up the sixth and final season makes these episodes a deeply unsatisfying experience.
Lisey's Story,0,"There are some interesting, often supernatural connections between the characters; the hard part is wanting to stick around long enough to see where they might lead."
Y: The Last Man,0,"Vaughan and Guerra have writing credits on the new series, but the irreverence of the original seems to have been scrubbed in favor of a more somber approach."
Queer as Folk,0,"A ripped-from-the-headlines premise may locate the new series in the white-hot center of modernity, but Dunn and company extract little insight from that aggressive timeliness."
And Just Like That...,0,"Far too many 2021 cultural touchstones and new characters are awkwardly parachuted into the luscious looking Michael Patrick King executive produced revival of sorts, as if to check a box."
The Offer,0,"It deserves credit for elevating my overall esteem for The Godfather in one respect: At no point in all of my viewings of Coppola's epic was I ever moved to scream at random intervals, ""OH MY GOD, WHO CARES?"""
Big Shot,0,"If you're over ten years old, you've seen everything here before."
Invasion,0,"Individually, none of the subplots builds to anything shaped by the careful arcing of a good short story, much less to anything that gives you reason to invest in the main characters."
Taboo,0,"Taboo is not so much a show as it is an ordeal, a slog through a miasma of squalid period clichés that's possibly even less inviting than last season's FX vanity production, The Bastard Executioner."
Sweet Tooth,0,"It seems unfair to call a drama about a ruined world a mess, but this feels, quite deliberately, all over the place."
The Offer,0,"While The Offer is an intermittently entertaining fictionalization about the making of the greatest movie of all time, your time would be far better spent re-watching the greatest movie of all time and the greatest sequel ever."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"The adaptation is so lazy that episodes begin with the lead characters reading lines straight into the camera, rather than anyone making the effort to work them into the script."
The Mist,0,"Given the understandably low budget, it would have been smarter to play with the unknown enemy in the mist instead of making such a literal horror show."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"On the whole, the series' inability to decide whether to play things straight or lean into the Ferrell and Rudd reunion makes it hard to get used to anything that's happening."
Little Voice,0,Never tries something original when a cliché will do instead.
The Wheel of Time,0,"The action, when it comes, is lively, if predictable, but The Wheel of Time buckles under chunks of tedious exposition."
Devs,0,"It's the overdetermined plot that's leaving little room for the characters to develop... They lack warmth, wit and human singularity."
Taboo,0,The series itself dives into bewildering sojourns through memory. . .or is it fantasy?. . . showing tribespeople with painted faces and bizarre asides in which James whispers in unfamiliar tongues to unseen forces.
The Mosquito Coast,0,"The creative choice to provide little to no backstory severely dulls the show's impact. The Mosquito Coast remains just a surface-level, sepia-toned thriller about a family on the run, mostly to coax the vanity of its patriarch."
Inventing Anna,0,"It’s an overly long muddle, never quite sure what it wants to say about its title character, or how to say it."
Joe vs Carole,0,"It's never ideal to arrive way too late to the party, and Joe vs Carole feels guilty of that, adapting the story of Netflix's Tiger King, a.k.a. Joe Exotic, into a limited series that dutifully replicates those events without much bite."
House of Cards,0,It's eight-hours of filler to set up an immensely unsatisfying conclusion.
The Mist,0,"Okay, it's possible I'm overreacting here just a smidge. But Spike's version of The Mist is one dumb piece of work."
Hellbound,0,An expendable attempt at a horror series that doesn't stand out. [Full review in Spanish]
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"The cast of Nine Perfect Strangers is too good for the limited series to ever be unwatchable. But after seeing six of eight hour-long episodes, I'm pretty sure the biggest mystery has nothing to do with any of the damaged characters."
Community,0,"Ultimately, Community has written itself into a hole that I'm not sure it will be able to dig out of."
Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,0,"Ashley Zukerman's Robert Langdon is an acceptable ""everyman"" hero with twinges of academic arrogance and situational awkwardness, but the overall mystery feels derivative and dopey."
Dr. Death,0,"Despite the show's few thrills, its structure only reveals an unsteady grasp of the story at its center."
Mad Men,0,The season premiere seems as exhausted as the decade it has chronicled so intensely.
Wolf Like Me,0,"Wolf Like Me might claim to be a TV show, but its really a movie. (A short one, at that.)"
The Offer,0,"Viewers would be better off watching the Godfather saga, as its a better use of their time  and its far more entertaining than the entirety of this series."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Hulu trotted out Little Fires Everywhere, an eight-part limited series that attempts to capture the sprawling nature of the source material, but ultimately fails."
11.22.63,0,"Awkward and flat, never matching the promise of its premise."
Stranger Things,0,"The scrappy, soulful energy that defined Stranger Things‘ early seasons has been thrown out the window, and all that’s left is a parade of ’80s movies Easter eggs and increasingly obvious plot twists."
Rise,0,"Rise is not the next Friday Night Lights, or even the next great teen drama. It's more like Friday Night Lite."
Fargo,0,"If all of this sounds like a lot of strands to tie together, it is-but unlike in previous seasons, many of these strands really feel ancillary to the gangland drama that stodgily occupies center stage."
The Undoing,0,"The Undoing has undeniably high production values and a top-notch cast, but they're in service of increasingly lackluster and inconsistent storytelling."
WeCrashed,0,Apple TV's first high-profile letdown doesn't know whether to satirise WeWork founder Adam Neumann or to idolise him.
Shining Girls,0,There was simply not enough here to fill all that screen time. “Shining Girls” would have been better as a 105-minute movie.
Limitless,0,"Limitless may give you an immediate high, but side effects may include listlessness, dangerous plot holes and a sinking feeling you've wasted an hour of your life."
Snowflake Mountain,0,"Despite what the title may suggest, there’s nothing all that incendiary or political about Snowflake Mountain. And unlike a snowflake, there’s nothing unique about it either."
Invasion,0,"Invasion doesn't appear to be all that interested in exploring, you know, the actual alien invasion bit of its plot - and that's a problem."
Lisey's Story,0,"The porousness of the action becomes frustrating and, ultimately, off-putting. I don't mind being toyed with by a show; I don't need strict linearity. But the willful swirl and the withholding of coherence are too extreme here."
The Offer,0,"Unfortunately, the resulting product is frequently too on-the-nose. If there’s any reason to watch, it’s for the performance of actor Matthew Goode as legendary Paramount executive Robert Evans."
Mad Men,0,"Gone are the days of ""Zou Bisou Bisou"" and Don's Hawaiian mortality freak-out. Nope. This season premiere, all we got was a cold pastrami sandwich with coleslaw smeared on the bread."
Gaslit,0,Not even Roberts’s blistering portrayal of a woman terrorised into silence is enough to save a drama that is somehow both plodding and overreaching.
Suspicion,0,"By the time Suspicion reaches its heavy-handed conclusion, we hardly care who done it and why they did it."
All American,0,"I expected more from this show - do better, All American."
Treadstone,0,Treadstone... just treads a lot of narrative water.
They Call Me Magic,0,"If viewers don’t already know the stories Johnson has previously told, they’ll come away either feeling like Magic was pretty boring or like the truth was pretty boring."
Lovecraft Country,0,"Rather than weaving the elements of the show together to buttress each other, Lovecraft Country simply piles up a bunch of horror tropes for no discernible reason."
The Wheel of Time,0,"How did Pike manage to keep up that sense of terrified, intense urgency, with all those boring plastic animals horsing around her? Where was all the swearing and off-colour shagging?"
Pieces of Her,0,"Slick enough to keep a viewer from turning off Netflix’s autoplay feature, but too broad and detached to generate much in the way of insight or emotional connection, Pieces of Her struggles to locate a beating human heart at the center of its mystery."
House of Cards,0,"With or without Kevin Spacey, it's possible that House of Cards had simply run its course. It's just a shame that it couldn't make one final sprint toward the finish line."
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"This update brings the star power of Jessica Chastain and Oscar Isaac, but can't match the emotional intensity of the original."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,Why are we coming back to all these people again?
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"This update brings the star power of Jessica Chastain and Oscar Isaac, but can't match the emotional intensity of the original."
And Just Like That...,0,"And Just Like That... isn't nearly as clever, funny or as interesting as it thinks it is."
The Boys,0,The series’ ideology feels increasingly hollow.
Prison Break,0,The nostalgia works against the show.
Entourage,0,"""Entourage"" heads into its final eight episodes starting Sunday night and to be honest, it's time."
The Morning Show,0,"These cobbled together histrionic dramatics are offensive compared to the gravity of the issues of the first season. Even combined, the desperate scrambles of the second season don't have enough bite, or credibility, for the viewer to invest in."
The Nevers,0,"It is, indeed, steampunk Buffy with corsets -- and for several reasons, that's no longer an enticing concept."
WeCrashed,0,
Twin Peaks,0,"The original run is one of TV's masterpieces, and Lynch finally returning to this project -- and unshackled by network restrictions -- was great news. In retrospect, limitations might have been welcome since this suffers from extreme excess and overkill."
True Detective,0,"The season had its moments, but it felt more like a vehicle for delivering a type of experience than a discrete story divided into eight installments. What's good about this show is almost entirely eclipsed by what doesn't work."
The Essex Serpent,0,"If you are hoping for Crimson Peak or The Others, this isn’t it either. But, if you are a fan of Jane Eyre or deliberately paced 19th-century British dramas with solid performances, you may enjoy The Essex Serpent. Just don’t say I didn’t warn you."
Loki,0,"The idea of Loki bouncing around history and stirring up trouble is more than enough ammo for a series, but Loki makes the bizarre choice of bogging itself down under layers and layers of bureaucracy."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Sometimes it seems to be a lampoon of New Age self-help fads; other times, an encomium to self-lacerating encounter-group culture; and occasionally, a creepy stalker drama. These are not the makings of a good jigsaw puzzle."
Earth to Ned,0,Alien puppet talk show falls short of Muppet expectations.
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,Adam McKay’s hodgepodge of postmodern filmmaking deprives the audience of any sense of discovery.
Foundation,0,The show's starry-eyed ambitions are dulled by its execution. Its scattered focus stalls momentum by introducing and discarding characters like a wad of receipts found in your back pocket after a night on the town.
And Just Like That...,0,"And Just Like That... is a massive departure from Sex and the City in all the worst ways. It trades in its wit for a humorless, tone-deaf sequel series that struggles to make any case for its existence."
The First,0,"Well shot, at times edited like an inspiring Super Bowl ad, the show falls into a curious trap of pretension. It seeks to be a ""serious"" show using astronauts, instead of being a good show about the potential of space travel."
WandaVision,0,"The end product is comedically wan, the double-takes broad and all the Olsen/Bettany/Hahn charm squeezed into tiny dabs of screen time"
Moon Knight,0,Oscar Isaac can't salvage middle tier MCU entry.
The O.C.,0,It's easy to deduce how the characters of The O.C. spent their summer vacation. They were practicing jumping the shark. They have it down perfectly.
The X-Files,0,"I'm glad Gillian Anderson isn't coming back for next season because if this is the direction the show is taking us, it's time for it to end."
The Haunting of Hill House,0,This Haunting is so far from the original source material that it's more of a demolition than adaptation.
Once Upon a Time,0,OUAT season seven suffers from the same anvil-ish dialogue it always has.
Taboo,0,The series itself dives into bewildering sojourns through memory. . .or is it fantasy?. . . showing tribespeople with painted faces and bizarre asides in which James whispers in unfamiliar tongues to unseen forces.
The Offer,0,"There's some good and bad with this... but at a certain point, you think ""Why am I watching a miniseries about The Godfather when I could be watching The Godfather?"""
The Pentaverate,0,"While I am glad I didn’t have to pay to see this on the big screen, I enjoyed laughing at some dumb jokes for a couple of hours."
The Fall,0,"Its hallmark traits of knife-edge tension, sexual discussion and psychologically-charged scenes have been posted missing, and replaced with an hour of medical procedures and jargon that would bore the most ardent of E.R. fans."
Suspicion,0,"It brings to mind an important lesson: television works when it uses the storytelling tools at its disposal, rather than just hacking a story into pieces and expecting viewers to follow it."
WeCrashed,0,"Its strong start meanders to [a] repetitive, inevitable end."
Foundation,0,"Its early episodes never quite reach that next level, or find the extra something special that made Asimov's work connect with so many for so long."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,It really should be known for is pulling back the curtain on the way the superhero genre can encourage the worst in us.
Invasion,0,"Unfortunately, Invasion also borrows The Walking Deads molasses-like pace, without any of the payoff or precise characterization. The first season builds to a climax, sure, but its a story that lacks depth throughout."
Line of Duty,0,It all feels very much as if Line Of Duty is running out of energy and impetus. Six seasons is one too many.
Inventing Anna,0,"Inventing Anna transforms a juicy real-life drama about a con artist among the influencer crowd into a fairly inert limited series, in part by giving almost equal weight to the reporter who broke the story."
Invasion,0,It's nothing but a kitchen sink drama as people are running and seeing weird things happening.
The Fall,0,This year's series has been the natural conclusion of the race to the bottom.
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,Adam McKay and John C Reilly join forces for a look back at the rise of the Lakers but strong performances can’t quite paper over a messy structure.
Inventing Anna,0,"While it may tell Annas story, it does so in the most basic, bare-bones manner, devoid of any real personality, fire, or even genuinely compelling characters  thanks mostly in part to the shows (sometimes painfully) lackluster scripts."
Ginny & Georgia,0,"Ginny & Georgia winds down its punishingly long first season having shouted a great deal, but said almost nothing at all."
The Boys Presents: Diabolical,0,"As with most ventures like this, the total assembly is a very mixed bag of quality, dipping on the negative side of the ledger here overall."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"The fights lack any excitement, physically or emotionally. There are a couple of fights where it felt like a constant back and forth with a punch, block, repeat."
The Endgame,0,"The Endgame is by turns boring and by other turns generic and nonsensical. Its story isn’t compelling enough to follow beyond the first episode, and we’re figuring that the interplay between its stars isn’t enough to keep people watching."
Lisey's Story,0,"Learn what is a Blood Bool in this florid, Grand Guignol Gothic fairy tale, that misses an essential element of heavy material - relief."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"Maybe a different creative team could've done a better job adapting The Shrink Next Door, or maybe Marty Markowitz's story simply didn't need to be retold."
The Staircase,0,"Campos brings visual panache to the project, but can never quite surmount the old aphorism that truth is stranger than fiction."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,We could've developed Bucky loads more.
Keep Sweet: Pray and Obey,0,Treating this saga mostly as a shocking play-by-play with a reptilian boogeyman at the center feels a little cheap.
Slow Horses,0,This spy thriller hitches its wagon to an insufferable performance.
Bridgerton,0,"Bridgerton Season 2 tries hard to please everyone, but ends up feeling watered down."
The Umbrella Academy,0,"This is the most apocalyptic-y apocalypse ever, but it carries no real weight. Then when you find out what has to be done to save the universe, it just feels very underwhelming. Samurais, really?"
True Detective,0,"The season had its moments, but it felt more like a vehicle for delivering a type of experience than a discrete story divided into eight installments. What's good about this show is almost entirely eclipsed by what doesn't work."
Normal People,0,The result is hardly incompetent but never bold enough to transcend the standard literary adaptation.
Arrested Development,0,"Arrested Development ending, or approaching the finish line, is the best thing for all involved. It's just sad to see everything wrap up on a ""less-than"" note and in a way that, ultimately, doesn't feel much like Arrested Development."
Bel-Air,0,It’s probably the most 2022 thing imaginable to take one adored show and reboot it in a way that feels derivative of at least a half-dozen other shows.
WeCrashed,0,"In declining to conjecture what WeWork’s nosedive meant for the rest of us, it’s got even less of a purpose than a co-working space during a pandemic."
The Undoing,0,"The Undoing has an intriguing mystery at its core, and a wonderful ensemble, but questionable structural choices give the series an odd ""stop and go"" feeling, padding it out to its lengthy runtime of 332 minutes."
The First Lady,0,"Despite a stacked deck of talented stars and what looks to be sizeable production budget, The First Lady is dead on arrival."
Suspicion,0,"Aside from a finale that feels notable only for its sloppiness, this thriller is about as forgettable as they come."
This Is Going to Hurt,0,"I’m not someone -- this is not a newsflash -- who demands that characters be likeable, let alone that their experiences “resonate” (ugh) with my own. Unlikeability, however, is a problem here."
Waco,0,"The Paramount Network needs something flashy and bold to ring in its launch, and Waco isn't it. The show should have been used as an addition to something bold, not as a starting move."
The Essex Serpent,0,Some viewers are sure to enjoy its generally slow pacing — and all that breathing the story is allowed to do — but others may find their attention drifting more than once.
The Staircase,0,"To call The Staircase a docu-series is a gross exaggeration. It is filmed entirely from the perspective of Peterson's team, an overwrought exploration of a self-involved family."
Big Little Lies,0,The flattening of previously full characters may be the biggest loss of this season.
11.22.63,0,No one would figure going back in time to spare the life of JFK would be easy or quick. But does it have to drag on so long and be this tiresome to watch?
Lisey's Story,0,"There are some interesting, often supernatural connections between the characters; the hard part is wanting to stick around long enough to see where they might lead."
MacGruber,0,"It's hard to get excited for a sequel to a film that wasn't very good to begin with, especially when the sequel is three times as long."
True Detective,0,"True Detective bills itself as something better, but really, it's just more of the same."
Ramy,0,"Even one great supporting performance, itself overcoming a relatively one-note character, doesn't make the season any less disappointing."
Killing Eve,0,"Instead of something small but perfectly formed, Killing Eve has become one of those programmes that seems mainly to inspire the response, “Oh are they still making that?”"
The First Lady,0,"Ten episodes in, you don’t come away feeling you know the stories of these women any better, any deeper, than you already did."
Black Mirror,0,"It's weird to feel so poorly about three arguably good episodes of television, but the short length of Season 5 only serves to highlight the deficiencies of the season as a whole."
The Outsider,0,"Curiously -- and annoyingly -- uneven, as if different production crews took over on alternate days undoing one another's work."
Waco,0,More notable for its casting than its execution.
Sex/Life,0,A Road Runner cartoon has more sophisticated characterisations.
Bridgerton,0,Season 2 timidly skimmed the surface of such representation when I needed it to leap into sumptuous storytelling. I couldn’t escape into it while I was also trying to navigate its unsatisfying approach to inclusivity.
The Mist,0,"This version tries to have it both ways - goofy and serious - and leaves viewers on the outside looking in, rooting for the mist instead of those running from it."
WandaVision,0,It's like plugging through porridge for the chocolate button at the bottom of every bowl.
Glee,0,"It's fitting, then, that the first hour ends with a Frozen cover that's over a year late to the zeitgeist... making it feel just as the show does: dull, overextended, and irrelevant. It's Glee's time-time to let it go."
Inventing Anna,0,"Inventing Anna is a meandering and shallow take on Anna Sorokin's story, glacially paced with superfluous tangents that distract from the character we're really interested in."
Truth Be Told,0,"Unfortunately, Truth Be Told 2 does not grip at the get-go."
The Staircase,0,"The problem is, in a good fictional crime story, the writers and directors feel a sense of responsibility to make you care. Here, there’s an underlying assumption that we’ll care, and that assumption leads to plodding, stultifying drama."
Inventing Anna,0,"Inventing Anna is a meandering and shallow take on Anna Sorokin's story, glacially paced with superfluous tangents that distract from the character we're really interested in."
The Staircase,0,"I strongly considered sticking a fork in my eye at least eight times while the footage rolled... and rolled, and rolled, and rolled."
Mr. Corman,0,"The audience doesn't have to like the main character for the show to work, but at the very least, its center of gravity should be more nuanced and compelling than this one."
24,0,"24 is still fast-paced for the most part, although a little slow off the mark in its first hour. And the 47-year-old Sutherland remains trim and limber as an aging Jack of few words, most of them downers."
The X-Files,0,"I'm glad Gillian Anderson isn't coming back for next season because if this is the direction the show is taking us, it's time for it to end."
The Staircase,0,"To call The Staircase a docu-series is a gross exaggeration. It is filmed entirely from the perspective of Peterson's team, an overwrought exploration of a self-involved family."
Altered Carbon,0,"For intriguing sci-fi action, stick with that strong first season. For the big questions, fellow Netflix original The Good Place is just a few short clicks away."
Preacher,0,"This has always been the thing with Preacher, from the source material on. It has plenty to say about humanity & faith & life, but to hear it you have to live through the juvenilia. With Season 4, though, for the first time, that does not feel worth it."
Pieces of Her,0,"While a new Collette performance is an event, the show often seems to be hiding its most effective onscreen asset, in favor of time spent in the past. And that past likely worked better on the page than onscreen."
"Love, Victor",0,"Whether the fantasy ending is due to an early cancellation or the desire to tie everything up with a tidy bow, this final season is unsatisfying. The characters are shadows of themselves, and the interesting messiness (and queer focus) is all but gone"
Coyote,0,"Breaking Bad director Michelle MacLaren gives this series a ""Bad"" vibe, but that doesn't insure it is good... Coyote proves watchable but too derivative."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"The tone wanders, mixing scenes in ominously idyllic locations with supposedly meaningful closeups of fruit being whipped into submission for smoothies."
The Morning Show,0,"These cobbled together histrionic dramatics are offensive compared to the gravity of the issues of the first season. Even combined, the desperate scrambles of the second season don't have enough bite, or credibility, for the viewer to invest in."
Limitless,0,"By the time viewers spend 45 minutes learning the rules, or lack thereof, of this extraordinary universe, sticking around to see what comes next may be less appealing."
The Expanse,0,"The season feels incomplete, an insufficient and far too economical kiss off for such an intricately constructed show. It's sad to see a world built with the breadth of the universe have no room to breathe."
Foundation,0,"Its early episodes never quite reach that next level, or find the extra something special that made Asimov's work connect with so many for so long."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,The problem: Danny Rand is just not compelling enough to carry his own show.
House of Cards,0,"The final eight episodes, which are all available for streaming now on Netflix, comes to a messy conclusion with more loose ends than a Florida election ballot."
Dr. Death,0,"Duntsch never adds up to a character we can understand, and standing back and wondering just how far beyond our understanding some people can be doesn't fly as the takeaway for eight hours' worth of entertainment."
The Undoing,0,"While The Undoing strings together just enough surprises to keep viewers interested episode-to-episode, its writing and direction are both muddled, making for an occasionally unpleasant viewing experience."
Tokyo Vice,0,It all feels as dated as Miami Vice's fashion sense.
The Wheel of Time,0,"As much as The Wheel of Time left me indifferent, I very much warmed to the universe of the Aes Sedais. Your introduction to them is Moiraine, and it's difficult not to be intrigued by her order. She's the type of woman who doesn't hear ""no"" often."
Y: The Last Man,0,"While some intriguing & important new elements are added, like Elliot Fletcher's trans character, the show is so concerned with big ideas it neglects all of its characters."
Brave New World,0,"This adaptation looks great but is definitively hollow, and in turn all of its parties, extensive discussions, and choreographed orgy scenes become simply exhausting."
Pieces of Her,0,The latest example of a miniseries that long overstays its welcome.
Mr. Corman,0,"Mr. Corman, the new AppleTV+ series from Joseph Gordon-Levitt suffers from a number of issues, not least of which is an uninteresting lead character."
Defending Jacob,0,"Part legal thriller, part whodunnit, the eight-part series stars an A-list cast, adheres to familiar crime genre convention and steps so carefully toward the finale reveal that it often feels more sleepy than suspenseful."
Limitless,0,"Maybe the show will improve when it kicks into the case-of-the-week format and ramps up the nonsensical effects of this mysterious pill, but I don't have high hopes."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,The series is ultimately uncertain of what it wants to say.
Star Trek,0,Talk about going out on a sour note.
Schmigadoon!,0,"Strong, who's one of the producers, is clearly having a ball, but Key is sold shockingly short by a lame script that starves him of funny lines and requires him to do nothing but moan."
How I Met Your Mother,0,"""Last Forever"" brought up the idea of true love versus soul mates, and a bit about fate, but if I wanted to watch a series about how your soulmate might not be the love of your life, I'd have watched Dawson's Creek, a series which did it much better."
Star Wars Resistance,0,"The bottom line is that Resistance... isn't really that good, or memorable. More specifically, it's a show that really doesn't know what it wants to be."
Archive 81,0,"Netflix's new horror show Archive 81 offers promising scares and intrigue across the board, but in its execution, it forgets the most important thing: the characters."
The Nevers,0,"It feels empty, as if the scripts are just going through the motions; the characters have so little substance beyond their spunky quips that the dramatic moments, when they inevitably arrive, ooze into each episode like treacle."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,Adam McKay and John C Reilly join forces for a look back at the rise of the Lakers but strong performances can’t quite paper over a messy structure.
Lisey's Story,0,This show is hellbent on driving me mad thanks to one of its biggest stumbling blocks: the absence of any sort of logic to this universe.
Brave New World,0,"[Brave New World] could have gone in any wild direction it wanted, but it opted for a take that feels like the safest possible outcome."
Boardwalk Empire,0,"Despite the show's relative longevity, this final season still feels like a perfunctory jump to the end, as if Winter expected Boardwalk Empire to last as long as Prohibition itself."
The Stand,0,Never rises above a slightly dreary competence.
This Is Going to Hurt,0,"I’m not someone -- this is not a newsflash -- who demands that characters be likeable, let alone that their experiences “resonate” (ugh) with my own. Unlikeability, however, is a problem here."
Big Shot,0,"The lack of proper development for its teen girls is the most troubling aspect of ""Big Shot,"" all things considered, the element that feels the most performative."
The First Lady,0,"The message that these women overcame barriers is hammered home, so that their heroism is never in doubt, never challenged along the way. That’s no fun."
Sharp Objects,0,"It has everything to be a hit, but Sharp Objects does not captivate. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Brave New World,0,"While it looks pretty, it feels thin. Entire stretches are given over to PG-rated orgies instead of clearly explaining the plot. Moreover, a TV series where audiences are supposed to sympathize with the bored and unhappy one percent feels out of touch."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"Ultimately, the first season feels a bit like a walkway to the real story -- or, more accurately, a runway. It's a lot of busy preamble."
Rise,0,"The cast is solid, but otherwise ""Rise"" falls flat."
Jericho,0,"Well the good news is that the show is kinda-sorta ratcheting up the focus on the ""what happened"" story, plus it's looking more into how the country as a whole is dealing with its post-nukey self. The bad news is, I totally don't care anymore. At all."
Lisey's Story,0,What's on screen can be bloated and exasperating. But Stephen King's eight-hour version of his favorite among his own scary novels can-thanks to stars Julianne Moore and Clive Owen-pull you up short with the beauty and terror of marriage.
Friends,0,"The ""Friends"" soap opera ended predictably and blandly last night, with no big surprises, just two little ones -- Monica's and Chandler's twins."
Suspicion,0,"It feels like Suspicion is a bunch of espionage scenes in search of a cohesive story. The story may reveal itself at some point, but right now, the whole operation feels bland and generic."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,0,"What audiences get is a family melodrama where mental illness is addressed on the way to another destination. There’s no doubting the sincerity of those involved, but ultimately this glossy slice of streaming content lacks teeth in its latter stages..."
The Book of Boba Fett,0,"The episodes had little to offer. And when they ran out of Fett's past and present, The Book of Boba Fett simply ditched him and switched over to Din Djarin."
Waco,0,"Waco has done far more ironing out than enriching in the episodes leading up to next week's grand finale. The Dowdles have hamstrung their own ambitions, reducing Waco from a reckoning with the muddled past to an oversimplification of it."
Waco,0,"What Waco needs, and fails to achieve, is a complex, unified theory of Koresh."
Little Voice,0,The stakes are ludicrously low.
The Nevers,0,"It is, indeed, steampunk Buffy with corsets -- and for several reasons, that's no longer an enticing concept."
Joe vs Carole,0,"Though it's based on the Wondery podcast that first broke the tawdry tiger tale in 2019, Joe vs. Carole simply doesn't contain enough fresh insight to justify its existence today  despite game performances by the stars."
The Morning Show,0,"Too often, The Morning Show's second season is satisfied with the easiness of shock -- of announcing itself, though not communicating much of note, in a blare."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,Nine Perfect Strangers boasts a wonderful cast that is sadly under-utilised within a series lacking both plot content and atmosphere. We wish we were seeing something on whatever wavelength Nicole Kidman's performance is on.
Amazing Stories,0,Those tuning in expecting to see the director's light touch and clever manner of engaging our emotions will be disappointed: The show's first installment feels less like a revival than a holdover.
Entourage,0,"Everything that went down on screen in this finale felt rushed, it was almost like no one bothered to tell the writers that they only had eight episodes this season and once they realised they had to squash episodes worth of material in to one half hour."
Moon Knight,0,"Moon Knight is a snooze fest. Most of it is about MacGuffins ... and as the hero and villain chase, find, and procure them, the new Marvel series becomes too plot driven. (This also results in obvious and unnecessary exposition.)"
Loki,0,It's nevertheless a bit of a letdown when you realize halfway through the dense first episode that one of the MCU's ostensibly most unpredictable lead characters has somehow landed in the most predictable of setups.
Dr. Brain,0,"For a show with a wild central premise and a goofily brazen title, nothing here rises to the level of wildness that the show is teasing, nor is there the sort of grounding that could work as an alternative."
The Mist,0,There's room for interesting rehashes that bring new perspectives and ideas. The Mist is definitely not one of them.One adaptation was enough.
The Baby,0,"It’s all pretty perfunctory and over-reliant on one single, repetitive plot point that ends up not being scary, sinister, or engaging enough to compel you to see what comes next."
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"It's meant as an episode of reflection, but because previous episodes have given the relationship a flimsy foundation, Scenes still ends on its flattest note."
Killing Eve,0,"Instead of something small but perfectly formed, Killing Eve has become one of those programmes that seems mainly to inspire the response, “Oh are they still making that?”"
The Offer,0,"There's some good and bad with this... but at a certain point, you think ""Why am I watching a miniseries about The Godfather when I could be watching The Godfather?"""
Reacher,0,"Ritchson's 12-pack is a physical manifestation of a tonal problem: His Reacher is smarmy and pleased with himself, rather than casually secure in his own vast abilities. He's a generic vigilante who just happens to look like a mountain."
Girls5eva,0,Despite some solid zingers... this sophomore batch of episodes feels listless.
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"[Mayor of] Kingstown, written by Sheridan, is another muscular soap that's long on characters talking in indecipherable lingo and short on clarity."
House of Cards,0,"It isn't easy to replace Frank Underwood, who... has become one of the most legendary characters ever portrayed on a TV show. However, it is obvious that this season not only lacked inspiration - it was lacking, in general."
Succession,0,"I come not to bury ""Succession"" nor to praise it, but to perpetually hope it will take up that messy space between paranoia and performative nonchalance."
The First Lady,0,"Watching the series attempt to make sense of itself, it’s tempting to believe that it began as three separate Michelle, Betty, and Eleanor shows before The First Lady slapped them together into one."
Joe vs Carole,0,You can see why Tiger Kings initial mass popular appeal lead to this drama being pitched  its a lot more difficult to see why anyone thought that appeal might sustain during the time it actually takes to make eight hours of television.
Midnight Mass,0,"Flanagan seems to have made a spiritual, contemplative turn in his life and writing. Good for him; not so good for those who liked his earliest stuff. I'm taking a pass on Mass."
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"You end up wondering whether they are true soulmates, or just trauma-bonded beyond redemption. Christ, you think, move on, but, alas, they won't."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"The new Hulu drama has everything going for it, which makes its failures even more striking."
Friends,0,"Even the kiss that cemented Ross and Rachel couldn't disguise the show's larger anti-climax, a cop-out from the logical conclusions of the show's premise, conclusions it began to acknowledge only to ultimately deny their existence."
The White Lotus,0,"The creator, director and scriptwriter of the series, Mike White... abandoned any kind of subtlety to establish a clear position. [Full review in Spanish]"
13 Reasons Why,0,This show has no business being a full hour long. And it certainly has no business leaving us with an hour-and-36-minute (!) series finale.
Twin Peaks,0,"The original run is one of TV's masterpieces, and Lynch finally returning to this project -- and unshackled by network restrictions -- was great news. In retrospect, limitations might have been welcome since this suffers from extreme excess and overkill."
Pieces of Her,0,"Toni Collette is a divine being sent from Heaven with whom we are all fortunate to share time on the same planet. Even Collette, however, cannot redeem what is one of television history’s most worthless characters in Netflix’s Pieces of Her."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,"Although '80s-style excess clearly accounts for much of the sizzle, this exercise feels like a no-look pass that skips out of bounds."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"It's a top-notch cast, and the collective strengths of the actors make the series sing when the rest is flimsy. But the mystery at the heart of it all... isn't always effective, more an afterthought rather than a prevalent riddle."
The Book of Boba Fett,0,"The episodes had little to offer. And when they ran out of Fett's past and present, The Book of Boba Fett simply ditched him and switched over to Din Djarin."
Angelyne,0,I liked “Angelyne” better as it went on... without ever being wholly convinced that it was a trip I needed to take.
Lisey's Story,0,"It's disappointing given the top-tier cast and production team. The three brilliant female leads are mostly weeping, catatonic or angry and confused, which is relatable to those of us struggling to keep up with the narrative."
Treadstone,0,"As spy dramas go, this one is better left out in the cold."
Behind Her Eyes,0,Anything beneath the surface in Behind Her Eyes is irrelevant by the end.
Y: The Last Man,0,"Vaughan and Guerra have writing credits on the new series, but the irreverence of the original seems to have been scrubbed in favor of a more somber approach."
House of Cards,0,"Robin Wright was one of the best things from the previous seasons of House of Cards, but season 6 simple should've never existed. The ghost of Frank Underwood became its doom. Full review in Spanish"
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"It's a top-notch cast, and the collective strengths of the actors make the series sing when the rest is flimsy. But the mystery at the heart of it all... isn't always effective, more an afterthought rather than a prevalent riddle."
Foundation,0,"""Foundation"" has the space for Asimov's seemingly endless plot points to breathe. Even so, it's much to take in, though creators David S. Goyer and Josh Friedman deserve kudos for making the effort at achieving the impossible."
Casual,0,"Somehow... the series keeps from being overwhelmed by all the changes, either to its characters or the world around them, and winds up in delivering an emotionally satisfying end to one of Hulu's most charming and enjoyable series."
Scandal,0,"Looking back, the real Scandal was that anyone kept watching."
The Mist,0,"Not nearly enough horror, way too much exposition (in the opener). Even the fog seems a little bored hanging around for something to happen."
The Shrink Next Door,0,A drawn-out true-cringe story.
The Night Of,0,"Actor/producer James Gandolfini's last project was meant to be a stirring indictment of the criminal justice system. Instead, it plays like an overwrought NYPD Blue episode."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"The best part about 9 Perfect Strangers is that the Wikipedia entry states up top ""not to be confused with Perfect Strangers."" Oh, how I wish that this were the tale of 9 Balkis..."
House of Cards,0,"Artistically, Season 6 of House of Cards is a flop."
Monsters at Work,0,"Monsters At Work will reward long-time fans of this franchise with familiar characters, callbacks, and more time in the intriguing world of Monstropolis. Unfortunately, all it nails about this world is superficial, and not even appropriately rendered."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"The way Ike silkily asserts control over Marty's life, and why Marty was susceptible to it, is a key element to all of this. But the show's approach is weirdly miscalculated."
True Detective,0,"The new True Detective is faintly pretentious, manageably ridiculous, and dull."
24,0,"While the format has been altered a bit... this new season is 12 episodes instead of 24 so some hours will be skipped -- everything else about the show is same-old, same-old."
Snowflake Mountain,0,"Despite what the title may suggest, there’s nothing all that incendiary or political about Snowflake Mountain. And unlike a snowflake, there’s nothing unique about it either."
The Book of Boba Fett,0,This spaceship feels a bit like it's on autopilot.
How I Met Your Mother,0,This finale seems to completely sour the show's legacy - something that is not more important than ever.
Pieces of Her,0,It just could have been so much better.
The Mysterious Benedict Society,0,"There is potential in here, though, especially through the committed performances from the cast. But right now The Mysterious Benedict Society needs more mysteries and fewer answers."
Invasion,0,"For all that money, we might have expected more. The plotting is occasionally a letdown too, bordering on infuriating."
Bridgerton,0,...it’s difficult to imagine that Bridgerton will ever make quite the splash that the first season did without stars like Page who strike the perfect balance between steamy and silly...
Lost,0,"It became a show about placating, even sedating, fans, convincing them that, in the absence of anything coherent or challenging, love was enough."
Ozark,0,"The show enters its final seven episodes with a problem: How do you create credible foes and foils for the Byrde's in such a short amount of time?... These rivalries feel like temporary fixes, band-aids applied to a gaping head wound."
Little Voice,0,"It can be a little wearing over the seasonal long haul, but it is true in its way to our sentimental experience and why nothing succeeds in working us up, and working us over, quite like a pop song."
Amazing Stories,0,"Without spoiling too much,""The Cellar"" feels overstuffed with narrative jumps and character choices that are often puzzling."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"There is something algorithmic, machine-made about the series, as if all involved were assembled by a computer trying to simulate buzz-worthy television. Come to think of it, that might make a more interesting series."
And Just Like That...,0,Nothing about the show feels organic; so much about it is painfully forced.
Star Wars Resistance,0,"The bottom line is that Resistance... isn't really that good, or memorable. More specifically, it's a show that really doesn't know what it wants to be."
Lovecraft Country,0,"A by-the-numbers story that wants to be bold and daring, and in so doing ends up not engaging with its own strongest elements."
Legion,0,"I responded to moments of Legion because I vibed with its project, but all of the aspects of that project ended up working better in other shows."
Behind Her Eyes,0,"Although it retains the book's shocking twist (it was marketed with its own hashtag #WTFThatEnding), even that is not enough to give Behind Her Eyes an edge over its umpteen counterparts."
Halo,0,"The derivative touches can't help but make the whole exercise feel generic, exhibiting a lot of hardware but not much creative spark."
Y: The Last Man,0,"Considering just how beloved Y: The Last Man is and its long development period, it's disappointing that the show's opening episodes aren't better."
How I Met Your Mother,0,The ultimate takeaway from the final season is that series creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas were at once too good and not good enough to tell the story they ultimately wanted to tell.
The X-Files,0,"I honestly can't tell whether or not Mulder's dialogue is supposed to sound ridiculous (in the second episode he utters this baffling phrase: ""Scully, you looked so adorbs"")."
Big Little Lies,0,"In under an hour, the finale reiterated what most of us were too afraid to admit: The charm of Big Little Lies was in it being a mini-series."
The Nevers,0,This weird mix of space and steampunk will confuse viewers rather than confound them.
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,The main storyline isn't strong enough and the incongruous peripheral elements just confuse rather than engage the viewer.
The X-Files,0,"As brilliant as Dana Scully was, and as badly as young women needed her, she remained frustratingly beyond the grasp of the men who wrote her."
Lovecraft Country,0,Lovecraft Country links to literary racism simply for fake topicality. Anti-American nihilism and hopeless racial cynicism give the show its gotcha.
The Morning Show,0,"""The Morning Show"" keeps returning to this idea that even as the network is drowning an endless pool of scandal and drama, these people care. I don't know if that's supposed to be meaningful or ironic, but mostly it left me feeling nothing at all."
First Kill,0,"As a cheesy teen soap with supernatural elements, First Kill holds some promise, but that quickly dissipates as the eight-episode season progresses."
Stranger Things,0,Season 4 was a 13-hour-plus behemoth that added Wes Craven to its mood board but otherwise ended with undeveloped characters and obvious but superficial allusions to contemporary crises.
The Morning Show,0,It's clear that whoever is writing the loaded conversations between these characters has never participated in one of their own to learn that this is simply not how we talk about any of it.
The Righteous Gemstones,0,"While fans of the show's first season will likely enjoy the second, its humor too often falls into the habit of reveling in the dumb, gross, and broadly obnoxious."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,The series is ultimately uncertain of what it wants to say.
The Stand,0,"Stripping this story of pretty much every shred of dramatic weight and emotional engagement is no easy task, but CBS has accomplished it"
The Stand,0,"Unfortunately, the sabotage of the novel's truly enthralling story-telling leaves its ideology as its strongest element."
Hawkeye,0,"""Hawkeye"" is too beholden to the larger MCU as a guiding narrative force and generic house style of filming to truly find its own voice..."
The X-Files,0,"Based on five episodes made available for preview, things remain uneven -- the first episode is dragged down by more conspiracy blather, interminable voiceover and way too many apocalyptic predictions of doom."
Inventing Anna,0,"On screen, the story is neither salacious enough nor studied enough to bring about any concrete conclusions. Instead, it falls into its own obsessive rabbit hole, and we dont feel inclined to follow."
Stranger Things,0,"Stranger Things 4 is a sad, indulgent, at-times-predictable slog. Episodes routinely run more than an hour and many characters are mopey."
The Last Kingdom,0,"Political intrigue and historical authenticity, not to mention decent acting, gave way to romantic slush, [and] unconvincing dialogue which could never make up its mind whether it wanted to be cod-Shakespearean or yoof-friendly."
Unsolved Mysteries,0,Unsolved Mysteries is likely to stay but it has to do better to become a staple series on the streaming service.
The Undoing,0,"While beautiful to look at, the show struggles to say something compelling as it's more interested in amplifying the melodrama instead of delving deep into its more interesting subjects."
Inside Amy Schumer,0,"All the sketches are well-produced, well-cast, and well-acted, but most are disappointingly underwritten, unfocused, or repetitive."
Bridgerton,0,"Season 1 may have left audiences hot under the collar and begging for more the first time around, unfortunately its successor is more likely to leave viewers yawning, such is the state of affairs with season two."
The Stand,0,"There's potential for this story to resonate very strongly with audiences at this moment in history, but the decision to present it out of chronological order puts everything it has to offer at risk."
Joe vs Carole,0,"Though it's based on the Wondery podcast that first broke the tawdry tiger tale in 2019, Joe vs. Carole simply doesn't contain enough fresh insight to justify its existence today  despite game performances by the stars."
The Baby,0,The best thing about HBO’s eight-part British horror comedy The Baby is that it rarely exceeds thirty minutes per episode. The worst thing about The Baby is that it’s a TV series at all.
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"It would, at this point, take a truly inspired interpretation to make a Time Traveler’s Wife series work. Sadly, this ain’t it."
True Detective,0,This season's attempt to bring back the old True Detective magic also feels a bit stale.
The Stand,0,"Boone and Cavell make a series of choices that not only diminish the awesome terror of the first part of King's novel, but the characters themselves, their journeys, and any reason we should care about them."
Weeds,0,I'm pretty sure there aren't drugs strong enough to get me to the bittersweet end of this series.
Stranger Things,0,The timing is terrible. The show itself gets slightly better from there.
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Is this an erotic thriller? A courtroom drama? An expose of social issues? At times it is all of these things, though most of the time it exists in the listless space between any clear genre -- or sense of identity."
Star Trek,0,"Season one changed the genre as we know it, and the second season equally so; it's just a crying shame that the third couldn't have made it a hat trick."
Godless,0,Godless has a great throwback Western movie buried somewhere under all the excess flab.
Marvel's The Punisher,0,Why are we coming back to all these people again?
Boardwalk Empire,0,"So many great actors, so little for most of them to do. Good acting can get you through times of confused and misguided writing, but can only take a show so far."
The Nevers,0,"The Nevers is an unimpressive monument to a storyteller whose work has meant a lot to many people, but who cannot now figure out how to rise to the moment."
The Right Stuff,0,The Right Stuff is inoffensively bland.
Wolf Like Me,0,"Wolf Like Me aims high, but ends up howling at the moon with some deeply implausible parental angst"
The Mysterious Benedict Society,0,"The first two episodes have a start-and-stop energy, with more tests leading to more tests, and it gets more and more tedious."
The Stand,0,"This new version has its inspired moments, like the way Billy Joel's ""The Stranger"" somehow turns out to be the perfect theme song for Flagg, but the structure keeps sucking the life out of things, from major characters to more minor ones."
First Kill,0,"The story is one you’ve definitely heard before, the leads lack chemistry, and the whole thing is lit like a deodorant commercial."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Despite risible dialogue and a disturbing swing toward cheap theatrics, this weak but watchable legal thriller still puts a human face on the MeToo movement thanks to committed, compelling performances from Sienna Miller and Michelle Dockery."
Defending Jacob,0,"The result is imitation-flavored television - a chronic occurrence, six months after the streaming service's launch. There's a larger mystery there, and someone needs to solve it."
Entourage,0,"The show's best days are behind it, and the eighth-and-final-season curtain appears to be coming down none too soon."
Lost,0,The feel-good moments at the end don't make up for six seasons of stringing viewers along without ever providing any real answers or any real closure.
Lovecraft Country,0,"There's something mechanical about Lovecraft Country's horror, both real and supernatural."
The Morning Show,0,"You've got to appreciate the moxie of a high-profile streaming series where a character blurts, ""Another streaming service? It should be illegal."" That's The Morning Show's second season in a nutshell: having its cake while choking on it."
Moon Knight,0,"It ends up feeling both bloated and disposable, something that ultimately has no great purpose to exist other than as another piece of content thrown into the jaws of the Disney+ machine."
We Own This City,0,"We Own wanted to be a thundering state-of-the-nation address on race and policing, but forgot that it also had to be interesting."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Because the cast is so strong, they bring some poignancy to these roles... These are all intriguing personalities. Yet Kelley and his writing and directing team can't find a definitive lens to frame what the story is meant to convey about them."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"Little fires will quickly merge into an overwhelming flame, and even though this is the first scene of the series, Hulu's adaptation goes right ahead and burns itself out."
The Pentaverate,0,'The Pentaverate' is unbelievably bad.
The Wheel of Time,0,What frustrates me is from the outset of The Wheel of Time is that it does that thing where it spends five minutes quickly explaining a world you dont know with terminology you have never heard or really understand.
The Mosquito Coast,0,"I can only speak for myself, but I don't have the patience for this anymore. At least Breaking Bad had the decency to make Walter White a tame family man before he went gonzo."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"[W]hat THE MOSQUITE COAST largely offers is an uninteresting family survival drama, with different villains introduced in each episode strictly for a reason to make the journey more gripping but add nothing meaningful."
Limitless,0,"There's a story to be told about what it means to be human in a tech-wild, catastrophe-rocked, profoundly uncertain age. Maybe someday, TV will give us that story. Until then, we get generic label pop like Limitless."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,0,The characterizations are beginning to get cartoonish.
Ozark,0,"More often than not, Ozarks double-crosses and shady dealings read like bullet points on a list the writers are running through, with no intrigue or connective tissue between them."
Catastrophe,0,"It's often snobby and more than occasionally mean. It has a thin, subtle story, and lacks memorable set pieces."
Homeland,0,"Medically speaking, it's probably inadvisable to treat bipolarity as a superpower. But that's where we are."
The Mist,0,The Mist unfolds as though we'll be surprised to learn that humans are capable of cruelty.
Rise,0,"Yes, a talented, experienced, ""difficult"" woman was passed over for a job because an amateurish white guy woke up one day and decided he wanted to switch career paths."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,It's a shame such a wild and impulsive character is likely going out on such an underwhelming note.
The Mist,0,There's room for interesting rehashes that bring new perspectives and ideas. The Mist is definitely not one of them.One adaptation was enough.
Lisey's Story,0,"This is intense, dark and disturbing material that could have woven the thread more adeptly through the needle. Sometimes we worry about Stephen King."
Schmigadoon!,0,"After having borrowed quite so heavily from traditional forms, the show only haltingly and gradually, and without much of the help that the neglected Key and Strong might have provided, arrives at something that can stand on its own."
Killing Eve,0,"Weve grown accustomed to queer characters dying on screen, especially ones in relationships. Keeping these women apart for the majority of the series, giving the characters (and fans) what they want, and then ripping it away is such a tired trope."
Losing Alice,0,Director and writer Sigal Avin so belabors the point that an idle mind can stray into self-destruction that Losing Alice paradoxically has the same effect on its viewers.
A Wilderness of Error,0,"Morris is asking us to consider an unlikely and generally unheralded possibility, and doing so in a manner so insistent as to make the proposition less and less appealing."
Foundation,0,"Its early episodes never quite reach that next level, or find the extra something special that made Asimov's work connect with so many for so long."
Killing Eve,0,"Weve grown accustomed to queer characters dying on screen, especially ones in relationships. Keeping these women apart for the majority of the series, giving the characters (and fans) what they want, and then ripping it away is such a tired trope."
The White Lotus,0,"By the end of the six-episode miniseries, the farce is still ongoing, but the joke is thinking that things could have turned out any other way. Fates were always sealed."
Arrested Development,0,"Unfortunately for the show, even without the controversies putting a cloud over proceedings, the simple fact of the matter is that this season just isn't that good."
The White Lotus,0,"The creator, director and scriptwriter of the series, Mike White... abandoned any kind of subtlety to establish a clear position. [Full review in Spanish]"
Invasion,0,Invasion is a slow burn that threatens to become simply slow.
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,None of these characters speak like human beings.
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"Jessica's 'what makes a hero?' path this season is given plenty of heavy-handed lip service but it feels more like telling than showing, especially as Luke Cage Season 2 handled similar questions much more deftly."
Safe,0,There are few series on streaming or anywhere else that will cause as few ripples.
Inventing Anna,0,"Delvey’s story is riveting. The series, sadly, is not."
Big Little Lies,0,"I admire restraint, and I can appreciate a destabilizing ending. But in season two, it felt as if Big Little Lies was missing whole pieces of narrative cohesion."
Halo,0,"The goal shouldn’t be about being everything to everyone, and while “Halo” treats the source material with respect, it does so with a tentativeness, as if it is afraid to miss a key element."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"The Punisher Season 2 isn't the worst season of Marvel TV on Netflix, but it's a pale shadow of its first season glory, and that's its biggest problem."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,It's a shame such a wild and impulsive character is likely going out on such an underwhelming note.
Taboo,0,"Not even often-stunning performances... can dig Taboo out of its messy, overwrought darkness."
11.22.63,0,"Awkward and flat, never matching the promise of its premise."
Arrested Development,0,"Coming across more like a tribute band to the series itself and ditching the controversial experimentation of 2013's Season 4, this second season of the comedy... is simply less original for a show that used to spark with cleverness."
Tokyo Vice,0,It all feels as dated as Miami Vice's fashion sense.
Man vs. Bee,0,"After a certain point, you stop questioning things and instead enter a fugue state. Is time passing, or are you just stuck in some horrendous ten-minute long Groundhog Day?"
Black Mirror,0,"With its move to Netflix, Black Mirror transformed from observing and satirising digital culture to becoming an active tool in some of its worst contemporary excesses."
The First Lady,0,The First Lady could have been great.
True Detective,0,"The season had its moments, but it felt more like a vehicle for delivering a type of experience than a discrete story divided into eight installments. What's good about this show is almost entirely eclipsed by what doesn't work."
Chernobyl,0,"At its best, the show emphasizes the layered venality of careerist buck-passing and the hopeful denialism of those who will refuse to think the unthinkable; at its worst, it suggests that these are specifically Soviet characteristics. They are not."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,Light on romantic chemistry and heavy on the cringe.
The Pentaverate,0,"The Pentaverate rambles and repeats itself too often, even if the glimpses of Myers’ undeniable skill almost make it work and might be just enough for those who have missed him so."
The Endgame,0,"There are no visual ideas here, no narrative ideas and no core performances to keep you watching while waiting for those other attributes to emerge."
Looking for Alaska,0,"This is all pretty stiff, predictable stuff, built around the operatic pangs of teen romance."
The Morning Show,0,"I'm not certain the show has anything to say, overall, about the news industry, about sexual abuse, about complicity, about cancel culture, or about workplace politics; so it has become one big time-filling mash of histrionics."
Angelyne,0,Rarely makes for more than a fitfully engrossing watch.
Arrested Development,0,Fine food never tastes as good when it is reheated a few days later. Arrested Development season five feels like reheated meat that smells way past its expiration date.
Lost,0,Does this mean all of Lost counts for nothing? It's another question I can't answer.
Outer Banks,0,"If you don't want to broach the issue of race here, then don't tie the treasure to slavery. But if you're going to make that link, you have a responsibility to actually talk about it and the implications."
Tokyo Vice,0,"After that first episode ends, and Mann hands off the show to other directors, an impression starts to build that the best ""Vice'' has to offer is behind it."
The Wheel of Time,0,"As much as The Wheel of Time left me indifferent, I very much warmed to the universe of the Aes Sedais. Your introduction to them is Moiraine, and it's difficult not to be intrigued by her order. She's the type of woman who doesn't hear ""no"" often."
Joe vs Carole,0,"While Kate McKinnon and John Cameron Mitchell give the title characters some heart in Peacock series, this tired saga should be retired with the Zoom Happy Hours."
Star Trek: Picard,0,"Season 2 immediately reverses track. Star Trek: Picard gives in to audience expectation, maybe even pressure, to try and tap not just a 1990s but also 1980s nostalgia for the franchise. It largely fails at both."
Lisey's Story,0,This show is hellbent on driving me mad thanks to one of its biggest stumbling blocks: the absence of any sort of logic to this universe.
The Nevers,0,"The world-building, at least, is extensive, and it's possible later episodes might benefit from having carved out so much narrative real estate, so many competing interests. But these early episodes are crowded."
Two and a Half Men,0,"Two and Half Men hit a new low every season and then continued to sink even further underground. During this last season, the show went off the rails in terms of absurdity and offensiveness."
Roar,0,All the starry turns and strong performances can’t make this anthology series cohere into a show that has something to say about contemporary womanhood.
Stranger Things,0,"Stranger Things 4 is a sad, indulgent, at-times-predictable slog. Episodes routinely run more than an hour and many characters are mopey."
Shining Girls,0,[An] intriguing but largely forgettable show.
Marvel's Agent Carter,0,"You wouldn't be alone in feeling that this season of Agent Carter lacked a certain urgency...that's really the rub, that Season 2 never seemed like it had enough to say on Peggy's journey..."
Moon Knight,0,"The newest MCU series on Disney+ has some interesting ideas and cool authentically Egyptian flavor, but takes its own little time to get rolling."
True Detective,0,"The towering talent of Ali almost straightens out the third season of True Detective from its ultimately dull centrifugal swirl. Yet,[it's] is overwhelmed by... capricious leaps in time and thinly spread philosophical space"
Two and a Half Men,0,Was that the sound of a piano crashing down on the hopes and dreams of 10 million fans?
Halo,0,I can safely say that the major flaw in this series is not the lack of accuracy or loyalty to the source material (though that certainly hurt it) but it is the lack of heart in the series.
WandaVision,0,"The classic-comedy pastiche is skillful, affectionate and well-performed, but it's not terribly imaginative - if anything, it's a little too true to its antiquated sources. It's also not very funny."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,"McKay has entered... an Aaron Sorkin-esque level of directorial obtrusiveness, where a filmmaker’s tics and indulgences keep calling attention to themselves, distracting from the narrative at hand rather than amplifying it."
Wolf Like Me,0,"Wolf Like Me might claim to be a TV show, but its really a movie. (A short one, at that.)"
Schmigadoon!,0,"Strong appears genuinely entertained and can hold a lovely note alongside the rest of the stage-ready cast. Still, neither the writing nor direction take advantage of the skills that Strong has honed throughout her time on Saturday Night Live."
Waco,0,"The only way the government could look any more like buffoons, barbarians, and jackasses in the series is if the ATF and FBI sequences were soundtracked with ""Yakety Sax."""
Altered Carbon,0,"The ideas behind the premise are so good, the potential to examine existential issues about identity and humanity and how they're tied up in our physical form are so great, that it's frustrating to see how often the show takes a too-shallow approach."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"The show's skittish unwillingness to look hard at its characters for longer than a monologue dooms it -- not to failure but to a sort of absence, making a show about people in the fight for their lives feel like something to have on in the background."
The Nevers,0,There is a lot going on in The Nevers. The only thing it seems to lack is a point.
11.22.63,0,No one would figure going back in time to spare the life of JFK would be easy or quick. But does it have to drag on so long and be this tiresome to watch?
Y: The Last Man,0,"t takes the swashbuckling, humorous tone of the source material and trades it in for a generic end-of-the-world ominousness that makes it seem like a forgotten season of The Walking Dead."
The Outsider,0,"Curiously -- and annoyingly -- uneven, as if different production crews took over on alternate days undoing one another's work."
The Mist,0,"Given the understandably low budget, it would have been smarter to play with the unknown enemy in the mist instead of making such a literal horror show."
The Haunting of Hill House,0,"Like everything in Hill House, that terror gets muted, slowed down and picked over so much that it ends up banal and lifeless."
Moon Knight,0,A series that ultimately feels rushed.
Rise,0,"The cast is solid, but otherwise ""Rise"" falls flat."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"The best part about 9 Perfect Strangers is that the Wikipedia entry states up top ""not to be confused with Perfect Strangers."" Oh, how I wish that this were the tale of 9 Balkis..."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,Why are we coming back to all these people again?
The Right Stuff,0,"The actors do their best to overcome the flat writing, and the show does find its stride by the fifth episode. What the new ""Right Stuff"" is missing are the qualities it can probably never have: currency and context."
Arrested Development,0,It's hard to argue that the show's maintained the sly political relevance that elevated it during its initial run.
Hannibal,0,It's difficult to love a show that seems to be trying to hard to be impenetrable to viewers to the point that it's practically begging to be canceled with such uninviting storytelling.
Mayor of Kingstown,0,It is a bleak drama series that doesn't seem to bring anything new to the table
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,The series is ultimately uncertain of what it wants to say.
The Mosquito Coast,0,The tone-deaf tourism of The Mosquito Coast makes for an adventure that's increasingly difficult to go along with.
Safe,0,"Safe could have been so good. All the ingredients were there for a prime binge-worthy crime thriller - the writers, the cast, the concept - but it just hasn't been given the time, care and attention it needed."
Bel-Air,0,"Once upon a time, Will from west Philly was miles from home, but the show he was in knew exactly what it was and where it was going. Bel-Air finds that a difficult trick to replicate."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,0,"Carrying those extra 15 minutes, ""The Problem"" drags; its monologues need honing, its jokes, if they stick around, need punching up, and its segments need to be trimmed down to the essence."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"Towards the end there was a 50-50 split between good and bad, but the first half or the show there was barely anything to like. A sad end for the Netflix MCU branch."
The Pentaverate,0,"We don’t expect The Pentaverate to get much funnier as the season goes along. And the longer we watch, we think the more painfully unfunny most of the gags are going to get."
The First,0,"For a show about people looking up to the stars in wonder, its gaze is disappointingly earthbound."
Good Sam,0,I'm as game as the next fan for a new House. This just isn't there yet.
True Detective,0,This season's attempt to bring back the old True Detective magic also feels a bit stale.
The Nevers,0,There is a lot going on in The Nevers. The only thing it seems to lack is a point.
Coyote,0,To be blunt: a show that asks its audience to connect to a rogue Border Patrol agent with literal blood on his hands needs to work harder than this one does to justify its premise.
Fargo,0,"If all of this sounds like a lot of strands to tie together, it is-but unlike in previous seasons, many of these strands really feel ancillary to the gangland drama that stodgily occupies center stage."
Snowflake Mountain,0,"It’s hard to determine how much of Solomon’s “personality” is genuine, but at least he provides some much-needed drama in this largely lacklustre series, which starts out so promisingly but soon peters out faster than a Gen Z doing the dishes."
The Nevers,0,"""The Nevers'"" inconsistencies can make for a maddening viewing experience - sending you from the edge of your seat to sprawled out on the floor, trying to find your eyes after they rolled out of your head... But I'd be lying if I said I'm done."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"Though the performances are uniformly terrific -- Ferrell has to walk the highest tightrope, making Marty believable but not too pathetic -- The Shrink Next Door is Exhibit A in streaming series bloat. There's not enough story to justify eight episodes."
Losing Alice,0,"It might have worked effectively as a 3-hour movie, but at 7 hours doled out over eight episodes, Losing Alice dribs and drabs, but mostly drabs."
Boardwalk Empire,0,"Despite the show's relative longevity, this final season still feels like a perfunctory jump to the end, as if Winter expected Boardwalk Empire to last as long as Prohibition itself."
Glee,0,"Although it's taken a step in the right direction, the show's previous ubiquity in high school pop culture leaves it as a pale imitation of its former self in the sixth and final season's two-hour premiere."
The Offer,0,"It deserves credit for elevating my overall esteem for The Godfather in one respect: At no point in all of my viewings of Coppola's epic was I ever moved to scream at random intervals, ""OH MY GOD, WHO CARES?"""
The Haunting of Hill House,0,This Haunting is so far from the original source material that it's more of a demolition than adaptation.
The Thing About Pam,0,"The thing about Pam, sadly, is that despite her crimes, she’s not all that interesting."
Alias Grace,0,"It's mostly restrained and respectable, with modest production values and uneven performances."
The Beatles: Get Back,0,"Clearly in an act of self-parody, Jackson has transformed what was initially supposed to be a two-hour film into a three-part series that is nearly four times longer than originally intended."
Heroes,0,"Maybe I'm coming off a little harsh, but after so many years of mediocre storytelling and promises of things being better, I'm over it."
The Undoing,0,"The Undoing has an intriguing mystery at its core, and a wonderful ensemble, but questionable structural choices give the series an odd ""stop and go"" feeling, padding it out to its lengthy runtime of 332 minutes."
The Baby,0,"It’s all pretty perfunctory and over-reliant on one single, repetitive plot point that ends up not being scary, sinister, or engaging enough to compel you to see what comes next."
Outer Range,0,"By the end of eight frustrating and haphazardly paced episodes, exhaustion sets in."
Inventing Anna,0,"Like Delvey herself, “Inventing Anna” is all flash with little substance — offering little insight into this enigmatic figure."
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,"That's a close metaphor for season 2, in that a prominent adaptation of a beloved comic property invites more scrutiny, and it's a shame it doesn't deliver."
House of Cards,0,"Robin Wright was one of the best things from the previous seasons of House of Cards, but season 6 simple should've never existed. The ghost of Frank Underwood became its doom. Full review in Spanish"
The Undoing,0,The real disappointment lies in the degree to which The Undoing shows itself to be simply a cheesy thriller.
The Essex Serpent,0,"A decent production budget and starry cast led by Tom Hiddleston and Claire Danes are squandered on a dreary, convoluted, portentous drama with all the appeal of a fog blanket over a giant rotting fish which someone briefly mistook for a dead dragon."
Weeds,0,"What was once a contained and quirky -- though sometimes dark -- comedy about a mess of a woman, has become a global disaster."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,It is a bleak drama series that doesn't seem to bring anything new to the table
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Sometimes it seems to be a lampoon of New Age self-help fads; other times, an encomium to self-lacerating encounter-group culture; and occasionally, a creepy stalker drama. These are not the makings of a good jigsaw puzzle."
What If...?,0,"[What If...? is] bite-sized chunks of comic book fun, however [the show doesn't] go further than being half-hearted fan service."
The Morning Show,0,"I liked that season one was a little campy. This season, however, summoned the ghosts of Joan Crawford, the cast of Grease 2, and Lady Gaga's Artpop era."
The Wilds,0,"The end result is a season that is overstuffed and yet drags, as though the boys sucked all the energy out of the first season, as they do."
The First,0,"Well shot, at times edited like an inspiring Super Bowl ad, the show falls into a curious trap of pretension. It seeks to be a ""serious"" show using astronauts, instead of being a good show about the potential of space travel."
Mad Men,0,"With each new season, I try to remind myself that the show is a slow burn. The first episode wasn't as glacial as the first episode of last season, but it still dragged a bit."
11.22.63,0,"I'm still not entirely convinced about 11.22.63 just yet. While I have always enjoyed Franco as an actor, I'm not getting the sense of conviction that I got from book-Jake."
Band of Brothers,0,"A glorious bungle... At times visually astonishing. Unfortunately it also suffers from disorganization, muddled thinking and a sense of redundancy."
WandaVision,0,"While it's far too early to assess the nine-episode, $150 million gamble fully, so far it's interestingly bad."
The Undoing,0,"It's all extremely rote, like an expanded version of the mid-budget Nineties movie that would have starred Kidman and Grant at their respective heights of celebrity."
The Morning Show,0,"After watching Season 2, I struggle to be certain what this show is about. The answer, at this point, really isn't ""a morning show."""
Chloe,0,"Perhaps the idea was to evoke the haunting effects of memory and loss which can never be completely resolved, but it felt like a deflating end to a drama which promised much more."
Taboo,0,"Taboo is not so much a show as it is an ordeal, a slog through a miasma of squalid period clichés that's possibly even less inviting than last season's FX vanity production, The Bastard Executioner."
Night Sky,0,More of an exercise in frustration than anything else.
Black Mirror,0,"In the best and worst exploitation tradition, ""Striking Vipers"" warns you not to treat others as a game. Then it goes ahead and does exactly that."
Altered Carbon,0,"It had good moments, it had bad moments, it had dull moments. I kind of wish now that there was just Season 1 standing alone as a great example of the genre..."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"If we wanted to watch a show that's relentlessly grim, there are much better choices out there."
P-Valley,0,"P-Valley pivots almost exclusively toward anguish and the tension between crime and punishment, and that thematic swing... overwhelms and undermines already-established plots."
Stranger Things,0,"Stranger Things 4 is a sad, indulgent, at-times-predictable slog. Episodes routinely run more than an hour and many characters are mopey."
This Is Going to Hurt,0,"I’m not someone -- this is not a newsflash -- who demands that characters be likeable, let alone that their experiences “resonate” (ugh) with my own. Unlikeability, however, is a problem here."
Westworld,0,"The new season of often wayward drama doesn’t just treat many of the people onscreen as NPCs. Withholding to a fault and placing a wearying emphasis on misdirection, it leaves viewers in the dark."
Sweet Tooth,0,"The show turns Jeff Lemire's lurid comic into a childlike adventure, but it loses the complexity, the ugliness, and the raw emotion that made the saga so rich in the first place."
Ginny & Georgia,0,"Ginny & Georgia winds down its punishingly long first season having shouted a great deal, but said almost nothing at all."
Brave New World,0,"Miniseries that scratches on Aldous Huxley's novel, staying on the surface. [Full review in Spanish]"
13 Reasons Why,0,The empathy of the first season has vanished completely. [Full Review in Spanish]
Shameless,0,Shameless fails many of its other characters when it comes to their conclusions. The series even does it in such a way where it feels like the show made a deliberate choice to avoid giving a solid ending to anyone's arc.
Defending Jacob,0,Underneath this tale... is pretty standard fare and about two hundred minutes too long.
The Stand,0,"While it may sound as if this would be particularly frightening to watch right now, the truth is that this much-awaited series is a bit of an anti-climax."
The Offer,0,"This program insists that movies are important, and does so by pulping perhaps the most celebrated film of the second half of the twentieth century and using it as fuel for a diverting but hardly cinematic streaming series."
Ozark,0,"Yes, I watched the second half of the Netflix hit series’ final season, and no, it wasn’t good. And I say this as someone who used to like the show."
The Night Of,0,"Everyone else, whether in jail, court, or the police station, is a variation on a character portrayed more distinctively in other TV shows."
Tokyo Vice,0,"An exercise in lost momentum, a glimpse at a fading underworld loath to offer any perspective on it. Maybe the wildcat was just a tabby the whole time."
The Last Man on Earth,0,The Last Man on Earth remains very much on the bubble.
Interrogation,0,The most disappointing aspect of Interrogation may be the writers' reluctance to peddle uncertainty.
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,"McKay has entered... an Aaron Sorkin-esque level of directorial obtrusiveness, where a filmmaker’s tics and indulgences keep calling attention to themselves, distracting from the narrative at hand rather than amplifying it."
Vikings: Valhalla,0,"Valhalla isn’t terrible. But it feels mostly like more of the same, without having much of an identity to itself. In a crowded landscape, that doesn’t give it a lot to fight for."
The Gilded Age,0,"The real American Gilded Age was a period of huge upheaval, but Julian Fellowes' The Gilded Age zooms in so closely that the arc of change looks like a plateau"
Tokyo Vice,0,What would Japanese people do without Americans around to explain everything to them?
The Stand,0,"In 2021, when there's more content out there than any but the shut-in or chronically unemployed can hope to consume, being ignored - as The Stand deserves to be - is perhaps the unkindest fate of all."
Amazing Stories,0,"It seems like this is another example of Apple having great star power, but not knowing how to use it."
Girls5eva,0,Despite some solid zingers... this sophomore batch of episodes feels listless.
Star Trek,0,"It's just an unlikely space opera, overlong, clunkily put together and not the slightest bit amusing."
Game of Thrones,0,"Season 8 reduced characters to caricatures, didn't earn its character development and the shift in their arcs, baked in several plot holes, and did away with internal logic and consistency."
Six Feet Under,0,"Now I've had it with people who insist on making themselves miserable, as if it were an art."
The Stand,0,Never rises above a slightly dreary competence.
Waco,0,"The Paramount Network needs something flashy and bold to ring in its launch, and Waco isn't it. The show should have been used as an addition to something bold, not as a starting move."
Altered Carbon,0,"This season lays hard into the sci-fi and moves away from the stronger narrative ties that would lend the story to its noir roots. While still a cool show hiring dope and diverse actors, I can't help but want more from the show."
A Teacher,0,t's a shame because those scenes show that the series is capable of good visual storytelling. So it just makes the whole experience worse when you realize the missed potential.
Entourage,0,It struck me that the show seems even more like escapist candy than it did just a few years ago... Entourage stopped trying to even toy with realism or emotional depth.
Foundation,0,"Not much about Foundation sticks, either emotionally or narratively. There are cause-and-effect relationships between one event and another, but they're stretched across long-attenuated frames."
The Morning Show,0,"There are too many people on this show, and without exactly being sure what the series' point is, there's no way for the writers to know who to focus on. But I just know it shouldn't be the men."
Inventing Anna,0,A dull spin on an otherwise captivating story...
House of Cards,0,I doubt that I was the only one whose own lethargy gave her cause for revulsion.
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,The problem: Danny Rand is just not compelling enough to carry his own show.
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,0,A series that started out a heartbreaker ends in a shrug.
Curb Your Enthusiasm,0,"The whimsy on the show is now so ethereal it barely registers. The setups can be achingly obvious and the punchlines disappointing. Besides, an ever more elderly Larry David as a single guy ambling round LA is getting tiresome."
The Nevers,0,"The Nevers is a huge mess, which has both far too much going on yet is also crushingly stupefying. The only bright points were Donnelly and Skelly, who shared an irascible chemistry."
The Staircase,0,"I strongly considered sticking a fork in my eye at least eight times while the footage rolled... and rolled, and rolled, and rolled."
Inside Amy Schumer,0,"Schumer is as brazen and politically conscious as ever, but this season feels less personal and less urgent than last season...and more formulaic-sometimes even bordering on lazy."
Bridgerton,0,"While “Bridgerton” Season 2 arrives with all of the scandal, gossip, and sartorial excellence we’ve become accustomed to, the sophomore outing lacks the fresh appeal and engaging pace of the first season."
We Own This City,0,"The six-part series isn't as rich as Simon's past work, in large part because it's built almost entirely out of rage. That's understandable -- but exhausting."
Lovecraft Country,0,"Lovecraft Country feels like a missed opportunity to repurpose the racist fear at the heart of Lovecraft's work to articulate the specific dread, isolation, and social death felt by Black people in all corners of the world."
The Right Stuff,0,"The Right Stuff is not bad, or even boring, just thin and unconvincing."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,0,"The split timeline is a plague on TV, and its latest victim is Showtime’s The Man Who Fell to Earth."
Mare of Easttown,0,"Gone are the days when HBO would produce only outright classics targeted at discerning audiences - in the streaming age, a wider clientele must be catered to."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"The storylines are byzantine, but they are not complicated. There is also no shortage of weary, heavy-handed platitudes, like fortune cookies that exclusively quote Bob Segar songs."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,Adam McKay and John C Reilly join forces for a look back at the rise of the Lakers but strong performances can’t quite paper over a messy structure.
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"There's a lot of missteps on the show that make its fires go out quickly. From its aggressive ambitions to tackle a lot of things to its unsubtle and heavy-handed melodrama approach, Little Fires Everywhere obviously suffers from most of it."
Normal People,0,An experience tantamount to being stuck on a bad date that refuses to end.
Arrested Development,0,"Season five proved that Arrested Development could imitate its glory years, but the Bluths don't seem to have anything funny left to say."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,Mostly Renner just acts tired and frustrated. The feeling is contagious.
Inventing Anna,0,The result falls flat. Inventing Anna is a stretched-out nine-episode romp that never quite catches the enigma of its protagonist -- or matches her appeal.
The First Lady,0,"For all its glossy production values and talented leads, a few episodes in The First Lady starts to show fatigue, like three highly padded made-for-TV movies spliced together."
The Stand,0,"For those who enjoyed the original inclined to ask, ""Why do I need this?,"" the answer is pretty well ""You don't,"" other than a promised new coda to the story written by King."
What If...?,0,"The light fun of it is eaten away by the cynicism from within the project, that what purports to be about infinite possibilities is blatantly more about repurposing."
After Life,0,"Hardcore fans of the show - which are legion - will mourn its passing, but for the rest of us, Gervais's maudlin curio remains a kind of purgatory."
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"This update brings the star power of Jessica Chastain and Oscar Isaac, but can't match the emotional intensity of the original."
Turner & Hooch,0,"It leans much too hard into the corny aesthetic of those kinds of lighthearted dramas, creating something too silly and childish for most adults, yet likely too old-fashioned for their own children."
The Office,0,"The Office has seemed lost, particularly by devoting substantial time to world-building Dwight's beet farm, a remnant of a failed spin-off effort."
The Nevers,0,"The world still feels under construction and confused about what its purpose is, something that feels indicative of the lack of a consistent architect throughout."
Star Trek: Picard,0,"While it starts strong, and it's focus on recontextualizing trauma remains earnestly admirable, the season ultimately doesn't have enough story to propel its 10-hour runtime, leading to meandering plots that rely more on nostalgia then storytelling."
The Undoing,0,"What starts out as a lively drama about scandal among the one percent turns into a turgid thriller and later a courtroom drama, recalling some of the hackier tendencies of past Kelley shows."
The Nevers,0,There is a lot going on in The Nevers. The only thing it seems to lack is a point.
Inventing Anna,0,"On screen, the story is neither salacious enough nor studied enough to bring about any concrete conclusions. Instead, it falls into its own obsessive rabbit hole, and we dont feel inclined to follow."
Moon Knight,0,"The 1st episode is fantastic, but the quality quickly drops off.  Steven is fun but Isaac makes the other personality, Marc, quite boring. Moon Knight & his mythology are sloppily defined,  making it hard to get excited about this new addition to the MCU."
Marvel's Agent Carter,0,It became... nothing more than a Hayley Atwell vehicle that let everything else from production value to narrative importance fall to the wayside if it meant the show's lead actress getting in just one extra spunky line of dialogue.
Suspicion,0,There’s not enough substance or character development here to hold our attention beyond the time it takes to click “NEXT.”
Invincible,0,"But both the jokes and the character beats that fuel Invincible are too sporadic to make the series feel anything more than sputtering. Unassailable, it is not."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"If the plotting and the characters in The Mosquito Coast were more compelling, it wouldn't matter as much that Cross has ignored virtually every element of his source material."
The Essex Serpent,0,"A decent production budget and starry cast led by Tom Hiddleston and Claire Danes are squandered on a dreary, convoluted, portentous drama with all the appeal of a fog blanket over a giant rotting fish which someone briefly mistook for a dead dragon."
Joe vs Carole,0,"The series doesn’t know exactly what tone it wants to take. It kinda wants to be camp, but it kinda wants to be taken seriously, it kinda wants to give you just the facts ma’am, but it also kind of wants to show you different sides of these characters."
The Pentaverate,0,The Pentaverate struggles under the weight of its main talent.
True Detective,0,"The towering talent of Ali almost straightens out the third season of True Detective from its ultimately dull centrifugal swirl. Yet,[it's] is overwhelmed by... capricious leaps in time and thinly spread philosophical space"
Fargo,0,"Outsize characterizations are not new for ""Fargo,"" but a balance has been lost here, with many characters standing in for the grandest sorts of evil and too few giving us what the series at its best possesses - soulfulness."
Defending Jacob,0,"The result is a story that feels both overstuffed and underdeveloped. Like its namesake, Defending Jacob is brought down just as it's taking off."
Sex/Life,0,"Sex/Life drowns itself in the shallow end, so to speak, by failing to even generate much heat. There are plenty of R-rated scenes-so many, actually, that they get repetitive."
The Endgame,0,It's laughable rather than intimidating.
Arrested Development,0,"What's missing here, to a depressing degree, is a sense of purpose."
Brave New World,0,"Miniseries that scratches on Aldous Huxley's novel, staying on the surface. [Full review in Spanish]"
Star Trek,0,Talk about going out on a sour note.
Devs,0,A product that delivers neither the wildly creative sense of tech's possibilities nor the ground-level excavation of his characters... Devs is a misfire for a talented creator.
Entourage,0,"""Entourage"" seems to have undergone a certain loss of identity, at least on the evidence of the first few new shows."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,The main storyline isn't strong enough and the incongruous peripheral elements just confuse rather than engage the viewer.
Sex/Life,0,"For a show about the basic instincts, it's unusually removed from anything recognizably human; for a look at what it means to heedlessly seek fulfillment, it's surprisingly sour and mean."
11.22.63,0,That the limited series squeaks by as just entertaining enough is a disappointment considering the pedigree of everyone involved and the reputation of its source material. Time travel and Dealey Plaza deserve better.
Good Sam,0,I'm as game as the next fan for a new House. This just isn't there yet.
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,Nine Perfect Strangers boasts a wonderful cast that is sadly under-utilised within a series lacking both plot content and atmosphere. We wish we were seeing something on whatever wavelength Nicole Kidman's performance is on.
The Flight Attendant,0,"While everything was new to Cassie the first time around -- making her a sort of classic Hitchcockian Everywoman, way over her head in this world of espionage -- the mystery here proves more convoluted and difficult to track."
Euphoria,0,"Euphoria is unrelentingly explicit this time around, as if it took one look at its former self and thought: no, not shocking enough, try this."
Big Shot,0,"For a show about an ace competitor who finds joy in victory, Big Shot, stacking a canny hero against a universe of people who just don't get it, sure doesn't mind playing unfair."
Ginny & Georgia,0,"The script's plotholes... [starts] so many stories that, in the dent, it doesn't end up providing the screen time that each one deserves. [Full review in Spanish]"
Battlestar Galactica,0,I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE YELLED AT A SHOW LIKE THIS. I WAS ROOTING FOR YOU. WE WERE ALL ROOTING FOR YOU! HOW DARE YOU!
The Man Who Fell to Earth,0,"The split timeline is a plague on TV, and its latest victim is Showtime’s The Man Who Fell to Earth."
Midnight Mass,0,"Flanagan seems to have made a spiritual, contemplative turn in his life and writing. Good for him; not so good for those who liked his earliest stuff. I'm taking a pass on Mass."
Roar,0,"Roar has built a daring experiment, bringing in a diverse group of female writing, directing, and acting heavyweights -- which makes the series almost fascinating in its failure to deliver."
Halo,0,The early episodes of Paramount+’s much-delayed new adaptation of the classic video game series miss their target...
30 Coins,0,"Bogged down in dull relationship drama and a confusing, mutating conspiracy, with only occasional flashes of the weird horror that the concept and the first episode's opening scenes promise."
Lisey's Story,0,"[Director Pablo Larraín] never entirely immerses us in horror or submerge us in grief. It's the opposite, actually. Instead of engrossed, I felt trapped."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"The Punisher Season 2 isn't the worst season of Marvel TV on Netflix, but it's a pale shadow of its first season glory, and that's its biggest problem."
Sharp Objects,0,"Vallée seems more interested in making everything look ""dark,"" rather than let his fantastic actors take us through their emotional journey."
WeCrashed,0,"In general, the series is a bit like the neon ""Hustle Harder"" signs that adorn the WeWork offices we see here -- flashy but vague."
Stranger Things,0,Season 4 was a 13-hour-plus behemoth that added Wes Craven to its mood board but otherwise ended with undeveloped characters and obvious but superficial allusions to contemporary crises.
Lisey's Story,0,"The porousness of the action becomes frustrating and, ultimately, off-putting. I don't mind being toyed with by a show; I don't need strict linearity. But the willful swirl and the withholding of coherence are too extreme here."
The Mist,0,"Okay, it's possible I'm overreacting here just a smidge. But Spike's version of The Mist is one dumb piece of work."
Stranger Things,0,The timing is terrible. The show itself gets slightly better from there.
Big Little Lies,0,"You don't hire a director like Arnold, with a distinct visual style, say that's what you want, and then edit it to be unrecognizable."
The Stand,0,"Boone and Cavell make a series of choices that not only diminish the awesome terror of the first part of King's novel, but the characters themselves, their journeys, and any reason we should care about them."
The First,0,The First is never quite able to blast off.
The Twilight Zone,0,"Technophobic and misogynistic... you're better than this, Twilight Zone."
Lost,0,Like the televisual equivalent of a keyboard-pounding poet... At least we know that we'll only have to suffer through one more season of this foolishness.
11.22.63,0,"If Stephen King could go back in time, maybe he'd decide to stop selling his books to television."
Homeland,0,"Rven though the circumstances are new... it still felt like déjà vu. We have had this vibe, this dynamic before - many times."
Limitless,0,"Yet while Limitless is competently executed, what it lacks, finally, is any spark of inspiration. And alas, there's no pill for that."
Euphoria,0,"There were some great moments, but this season could have been better. You really wanted to see more for all of these characters because the actors are genuinely so talented. You don't want to see characters be pushed to the side."
A Teacher,0,"That economy is one noticeable thing about ""A Teacher."" More noticeable is how seldom it feels like a cautionary tale, despite the onscreen cautions and referrals to sexual assault resources and the story's occasional explicit references."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"Herschkoph is inherently unlikable, decidedly shifty and lacking in moral fiber, while Markowitz simply misses a backbone. Epiphanies, gumption or redeemable characteristics are in short supply, meaning there is little to get behind as a viewer."
Limitless,0,"The superhero aspects can be fun to watch, but they don't make a lot of sense."
Arrested Development,0,"Coming across more like a tribute band to the series itself and ditching the controversial experimentation of 2013's Season 4, this second season of the comedy... is simply less original for a show that used to spark with cleverness."
Brave New World,0,"As it unfolds, ""Brave New World"" fits only the most nebulous sense of the word ""interesting,"" with its most relevant commentary left behind in the Savage Lands."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"I wish the series had more of a clear idea of what its genre was, other than crazy and trippy. Nine Perfect Strangers is at its best when Bobby Cannavale and Melissa McCarthy are allowed to display all of their comedic aptitude on screen."
House of Cards,0,"In the moments when Claire is allowed not just the camera but the story, ""House of Cards"" is a ride; when the past is relitigated and the specter of Frank rears up once more, it feels like that worst thing a binge-able drama can be: a trudge."
Big Little Lies,0,"You don't hire a director like Arnold, with a distinct visual style, say that's what you want, and then edit it to be unrecognizable."
The Offer,0,Am offer you can refuse.
The Right Stuff,0,The story crawls along incrementally without using all that time to let us know its characters as anything but the broadest of archetypes.
Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,0,"""The Lost Symbol"" feels like something you'd watch on Saturday morning cable when the remote is lost, though Peacock might be hoping to secure fans of the ""Librarians"" franchise, too."
The Act,0,"Like many miniseries, the show suffers from pacing issues, hitting the same beats repeatedly to the point of frustration."
After Life,0,"Treated with a little more care, I suppose all of this could be saying really interesting things about male failure and loneliness. It's lazy, though. No idea or message is ever pursued. Nothing is."
The Big Conn,0,"The Big Conn bites off plenty, and occasionally more than it should chew, distending its scope to the point that it loses sight of Conn, whose over-the-top brazenness is the most interesting aspect of this saga."
The Offer,0,The depictions of real-life actors border on mimicry... The various Mafia personages appear to have watched The Godfather once too often.
The Morning Show,0,"If the first season was about the Me Too movement, the second season is about... well, I'm not sure really. The show says so much without saying anything at all."
Sex/Life,0,The eight-episode season easily could’ve been boiled down into two TikToks...
The OA,0,"The willing suspension of disbelief has to be earned, and from where I'm standing, The OA doesn't earn it."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,0,"Like the Don't Bothers - like the show itself, really - she's in there swinging, but doesn't score very often."
Treadstone,0,"While the action in Treadstone is great, there just isn't enough plot to make a satisfying watch."
Mr. Robot,0,"At this moment in time, however, Mr Robot seems just as likely to spend its final episodes chasing its tail."
Lisey's Story,0,"Lisey's Story's failings aren't an indictment of King the screenwriter, they're a tribute to King the novelist."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Despite risible dialogue and a disturbing swing toward cheap theatrics, this weak but watchable legal thriller still puts a human face on the MeToo movement thanks to committed, compelling performances from Sienna Miller and Michelle Dockery."
24,0,This 24 revival seems motivated by more pragmatic and mercenary considerations: trying to wring a few more nuggets out of a played-out goldmine.
The Queen's Gambit,0,"While it is frustrating to see Black characters still reduced to stereotypes in what has been the supposed golden age for Black roles and representation in television, it's not all that surprising."
WandaVision,0,"Once WandaVision starts recycling the same content in each episode, it becomes difficult to ignore that the show's primary interest is playing with form rather than propelling its story forward."
The Endgame,0,It's laughable rather than intimidating.
The Essex Serpent,0,"Against this beautiful backdrop, the human drama never crackles. Directed by Clio Barnard, the show seems to forget that, along with all the portentous symbolism, there needs to be a spark of wit or a flicker of emotional depth."
The Offer,0,"Viewers would be better off watching the Godfather saga, as its a better use of their time  and its far more entertaining than the entirety of this series."
Brave New World,0,"The nine-part debut season feels like it's built on miscalculation atop miscalculation, but the gravest one is that the citizens of New London are effectively extraterrestrials."
P-Valley,0,"P-Valley pivots almost exclusively toward anguish and the tension between crime and punishment, and that thematic swing... overwhelms and undermines already-established plots."
Brave New World,0,"Welcome to this not-so Brave New World, where all the ideas feel old and not nearly as deeply considered as the creators think. But, hey, at least it all looks fabulous."
The Me You Can't See,0,"As an exploration of trauma and mental health, however - and one that features testimonials from figures such as Lady Gaga and Glenn Close - it's frustratingly unambitious."
A Teacher,0,"At a time when TV embraces inventive and risky storytelling, ""A Teacher"" looks and feels like something that belonged on cable 10 years ago."
After Life,0,It's a season that betrays its own legacy and destroys the absolute brilliance of the first season.
The First,0,"The series may well develop into an absorbing character-led take on humankind's dream of exploring the solar system, but Willimon seemed to be relying on the audience having a bite at the second episode before deciding."
Rise,0,"Rise wants to be an inspiring drama. More accurate to describe it as a drama about wanting to be inspirational...Rise seems uninterested in its own best instincts, willing to bring up ideas but unwilling to carry them over the finish line."
The Crown,0,The show seriously falters with Diana... The Crown prides itself on verisimilitude and that starts to fall away in Season 4.
Suspicion,0,Suspicion is a show consistently filled with incident it can sometimes trick you into thinking it is complex.
WandaVision,0,"It feels empty and aimless, like the writers wanted an avenue to play with the TV eras, but didn't think hard enough about how to make WandaVision independent of the past."
The Gilded Age,0,It comes at you like an undulating wall of plastinated velvet. Watch a single minute of any of this overstyled nine-part period monstrosity about rich American families and you will end up gasping: what is this gopping Edith Wharton-style product?
Sex/Life,0,Dig a little deeper and you'll find a very naked truth: Sex/Life is nothing more than a series of dimly-lit sex scenes propped up by groan-inducing dialogue.
Ginny & Georgia,0,"Ginny & Georgia wants us to love the way that Georgia always manages to stay one step ahead... Instead, I kept hoping that Child Protective Services would finally catch up."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,A disappointing bleak drama that doesn't have anything new to say.
Treadstone,0,Kring still hasn't figured out that momentum isn't the same thing as complexity...
The Mosquito Coast,0,"""The Mosquito Coast"" works best when you just follow along with the running and don't think too hard about the rest, but the running itself becomes tedious after awhile. Not everything makes perfect sense, or seems remotely plausible."
Shadow and Bone,0,"'Shadow and Bone' is trying to show way too much in too little time, leaving its best intentions emotionally stunted and inert."
The First Lady,0,The First Lady could have been great.
Naomi,0,"On both the teen and super aspects, this series misses the mark."
Lisey's Story,0,"The back half of this miniseries is so bogged down by inconsistent pacing, drawn-out scenes, muddled plotting, and a frustratingly anticlimactic ending that all the good Lisey's Story delivers before that collapse ends up overshadowed."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,The true scandal is how lazy it all feels.
Bridgerton,0,"The first episode in the new season lasts eight hours and 24 minutes. No, not really. It does feel interminable, though."
Arrested Development,0,"The meandering plot sucks the charm from everything. The characters feel oddly as though they don't get to exhibit or develop the traits we know them by, as they're usually too busy rattling off exposition."
Outlander,0,When we return to Fraser’s Ridge things start out a little slow -- and not in the good “let’s just hang out with the family” kind of way.
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Anatomy of a Scandal struggles to thread the needle between [its] two impulses, resulting in a show that’s unsatisfying as either a lurid thriller or a serious drama."
And Just Like That...,0,Nothing about the show feels organic; so much about it is painfully forced.
Mr. Corman,0,I wonder with Joseph Gordon-Levitt wearing too many creative hats that he's juggling too many ideas both with the storytelling and the creative vision to keep up emotional drive within the series.
Night Sky,0,"A low-heat, flat-toned, limited effects science fiction Big Secret movie whose “streaming series” stretchmarks show in every damned episode."
Reacher,0,"Ritchson's 12-pack is a physical manifestation of a tonal problem: His Reacher is smarmy and pleased with himself, rather than casually secure in his own vast abilities. He's a generic vigilante who just happens to look like a mountain."
The OA,0,Annoying. Gripping. But annoying.
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"Even though he was a compelling scene-stealer in Daredevil, Frank Castle/The Punisher has never felt quite right in his own show. Season two will do little to change that impression."
The Thing About Pam,0,The flourishes used on The Thing About Pam were tiring us out by the end of the first episode; we can’t imagine how exhausted we’ll feel after watching the entire six-episode season.
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,0,The characterizations are beginning to get cartoonish.
Invasion,0,Invasion proceeds so incrementally across such a wide range of characters and their responses to extraterrestrial terrorism that you might well lose your way from week to week. Never mind your interest.
The Haunting of Hill House,0,"Things were going so well. Now here I am, out back in the cold of night, burying it."
Bridgerton,0,"The show tries to tack on more substantive themes, while still ignoring the ways that its world-building has come up short."
The Wheel of Time,0,"Shows like The Wheel of Time feel reverse-engineered from an ideal outcome. And, unlike in fantasies, prophecies in the real world aren't guaranteed to come true..."
The Stranger,0,"'The Stranger' is an effective and addictive thriller, but despite its overabundance of elements, it is incredibly meaningless. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Schmigadoon!,0,It's one of those comedies that works well enough at the moment and only loses the melody when one considers how great it could and should have been.
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"What's frustrating about Little Fires Everywhere is that the discrepancy between the novel and the miniseries implies that A-list actors are all the show has to offer, when what should really shine is Ng's wise, haunting story."
They Call Me Magic,0,"It's a story that could easily have been told within the confines of a traditional 90 minutes (or less), but the style nowadays is to stretch out the form in order to make it an event."
Midnight Mass,0,"While some of the show's themes are talked to death, others wither away, undeveloped."
The Sopranos,0,One can understand David Chase's desire to have a completely unique ending... But that doesn't mean we have to like it.
The OA,0,"The willing suspension of disbelief has to be earned, and from where I'm standing, The OA doesn't earn it."
The Stand,0,Never rises above a slightly dreary competence.
The Beatles: Get Back,0,"As a document of the breakdown of the Beatles, Get Back seems to exist for posterity rather than enjoyment."
Monsters at Work,0,An unremarkable journey through ideas we've already seen done better before.
Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,0,There's nothing Ashley Zukerman could have done to make Robert Landgon less of a butthead; his insufferability is a problem with the writing of the show.
Midnight Mass,0,"They could have just gone so much further with... the mysticism, the miracles, and even the backstories of these characters."
The Summer I Turned Pretty,0,"The series is striving to capture that feeling of first love, of growing up and finding your own path. There’s moody music, hazy photography, and characters in slow motion. And yet, none of it quite works."
Shining Girls,0,[An] intriguing but largely forgettable show.
The Undoing,0,"The Undoing has undeniably high production values and a top-notch cast, but they're in service of increasingly lackluster and inconsistent storytelling."
Lisey's Story,0,"Learn what is a Blood Bool in this florid, Grand Guignol Gothic fairy tale, that misses an essential element of heavy material - relief."
Ginny & Georgia,0,"Ginny & Georgia winds down its punishingly long first season having shouted a great deal, but said almost nothing at all."
Stranger Things,0,Season 4 was a 13-hour-plus behemoth that added Wes Craven to its mood board but otherwise ended with undeveloped characters and obvious but superficial allusions to contemporary crises.
Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol,0,"It quickly plummets into your bog-standard, formulaic Dan Brown storyline in which Langdon is a helpless prisoner of a contrived, all-constraining plot."
Jericho,0,Whom can you trust? What can you do? Where the hell is this going?
Entourage,0,Entourage completely lost sight of what it was.
The Nevers,0,Astonishingly pedestrian.
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"[It] spends a great deal of time drip feeding epiphanies, dwelling in personal moments and dealing in character and yet there is a disconnect. Production design, cinematography and score all come together with direction and tone yet something is missing"
The Night Of,0,"This drawn-out, plodding miniseries stretches every one of its meager strengths beyond its breaking point."
The O.C.,0,It's easy to deduce how the characters of The O.C. spent their summer vacation. They were practicing jumping the shark. They have it down perfectly.
God's Favorite Idiot,0,"The series has a lot more high concept ambition and creativity than the husband-and-wife team’s previous collaborations like Tammy, but most of the laughs come from straightforward sitcom scenes of bickering co-workers."
Halo,0,"Those of us who don’t recognise every re-enacted power-up bleep and helmet-cam vision of destruction will probably find ourselves wondering, much of the time, quite what is going on."
Lovecraft Country,0,"Rather than be precise in its refutation of the legacy of Lovecraft, Lovecraft Country only takes the broadest possible swipes at the monster of racism, leaving the show feeling oddly one-note and shallow."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,We could've developed Bucky loads more.
Love Life,0,"No matter how much you can appreciate the character's journey, it's not easy for any actor to carry this type of story, but Harper would make you believe otherwise. Here's hoping he gets even better material moving forward."
The Mist,0,"This version tries to have it both ways - goofy and serious - and leaves viewers on the outside looking in, rooting for the mist instead of those running from it."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"It's an admirable effort, but one that simply underscores how unadaptable this material might be -- the bottom line being that if time is indeed precious, these six episodes finally feel too much like a waste of it."
Girls,0,"Girls was insistently offbeat, and in defiance of TV convention, a character study more than an ensemble piece - even if it wasn't quite willing to admit that."
The Pentaverate,0,Little more than a cheap excuse for Myers to put on some prosthetics and do silly voices
Marvel's Agent Carter,0,[The setup is] opting for beats so trite that they feel like they're coming out of a spy parody.
The First,0,"Sluggishly paced and too familiar in its character beats, it's the sort of prestige project that surely looked good on paper but fizzles once exposed to air."
This Way Up,0,"Lame gags come thick and fast. But, in an all-too-convenient cop-out, we're frequently reminded that cracking lame gags is a crucial aspect of the protagonists' coping techniques."
WandaVision,0,"As an exercise in cloning, it's all morbidly fascinating: The re-creations of the various classic shows and their styles display both a knowledge of and deep affection for old-time TV... But what was tedious then is tedious now."
Brave New World,0,"""Antiseptic"" doesn't begin to describe it."
Halo,0,The frustrating thing about Halo is that it tries to serve two masters -- diehard Halo fans and newbies who are used to the normal rhythms of sci-fi streaming series -- and doesn’t quite please either.
The Nevers,0,"The Nevers is a huge mess, which has both far too much going on yet is also crushingly stupefying. The only bright points were Donnelly and Skelly, who shared an irascible chemistry."
The Mist,0,"To basically every character in The Mist, allow me to paraphrase the hero of the movie version of a different Stephen King novella: Get busy being better written, or get busy dying."
House of Cards,0,"Plans, schemes, endgames -- who has any use for those? The crazier Washington became, the more House of Cards lost its touch."
Looking for Alaska,0,"This is all pretty stiff, predictable stuff, built around the operatic pangs of teen romance."
Suspicion,0,"By the time Suspicion reaches its heavy-handed conclusion, we hardly care who done it and why they did it."
First Kill,0,"First Kill is a soapy supernatural star-crossed romance that doesn’t break any new ground in the genre, or elevate itself above the other mediocre series of its ilk."
Limitless,0,"It's not heavy-handed and it doesn't dumb down its audience (although you do have to buy into the NZT brainpower stuff), it just feels like it's missing something, and I think that something may be a level of investment in the characters."
Big Little Lies,0,"But by the end of season two of Big Little Lies, I not only didn't fully get what I wanted from it, I didn't feel like I got what I needed, either."
Snowflake Mountain,0,"Despite what the title may suggest, there’s nothing all that incendiary or political about Snowflake Mountain. And unlike a snowflake, there’s nothing unique about it either."
The Stand,0,"Boone and Cavell make a series of choices that not only diminish the awesome terror of the first part of King's novel, but the characters themselves, their journeys, and any reason we should care about them."
13 Reasons Why,0,This show has no business being a full hour long. And it certainly has no business leaving us with an hour-and-36-minute (!) series finale.
The Morning Show,0,"There are too many people on this show, and without exactly being sure what the series' point is, there's no way for the writers to know who to focus on. But I just know it shouldn't be the men."
Invincible,0,"Once the initial face-punch of that first episode wears off, there's not enough powering (or superpowering) ""Invincible."""
Limitless,0,"Sad to see the great Jennifer Carpenter of Dexter in such a lesser cop show, another network one that tries to keep us past the commercial breaks with action and CGI razzle-dazzle."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Out of all the thriller fare that Kelley has adapted for the small screen to date, the whole of Anatomy of a Scandal is disappointingly much less compelling than the sum of its parts."
Bridgerton,0,Bridgerton season 2 is a lackluster season that hopes to recapture the heights of its first but mostly falls short.
The Morning Show,0,"It wants us to be content to marvel at its framework of aspiration and drive, along with loving its two co-stars. After a point, though, the performances aren't enough of a reason to continue ignoring the story's lack of substance, guts and a soul."
Mad Men,0,"With each new season, I try to remind myself that the show is a slow burn. The first episode wasn't as glacial as the first episode of last season, but it still dragged a bit."
Looking for Alaska,0,"""Looking For Alaska"" is nostalgic for itself, like it's admiring itself in a mirror instead of making eye contact. This neutralizes the immediacy and intimacy that can make coming-of-age stories so special."
Monsters at Work,0,"Rather than lending fresh new eyes to a world first established two decades ago, Gannaway and company play a Greatest Hits montage of Monsters Inc. references."
Invasion,0,"Invasion doesn't appear to be all that interested in exploring, you know, the actual alien invasion bit of its plot - and that's a problem."
Lisey's Story,0,"Despite the involvement of starry names in front of and behind the camera, intriguing fantasy elements and fascinating themes, the show never achieves the resonance it seems to be reaching for"
Dr. Brain,0,"Too often Dr. Brain dodges the dark freakiness of its central idea and instead lingers on rote, slow-moving mystery plotting."
Shining Girls,0,Too many threads are left dangling or unexplained. You never get that satisfying feeling of everything clicking into place by the end.
Weeds,0,It felt like the Weeds finale could have been more focused and a bit more eventful.
11.22.63,0,"Awkward and flat, never matching the promise of its premise."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Because the cast is so strong, they bring some poignancy to these roles... These are all intriguing personalities. Yet Kelley and his writing and directing team can't find a definitive lens to frame what the story is meant to convey about them."
Waco,0,"What Waco needs, and fails to achieve, is a complex, unified theory of Koresh."
The Gilded Age,0,"Julian Fellowes chased his new series, ""The Gilded Age,"" for a decade. Call it his white whale... you can watch it drag him and a large, talented cast beneath the waves."
The Offer,0,The depictions of real-life actors border on mimicry... The various Mafia personages appear to have watched The Godfather once too often.
The O.C.,0,It's easy to deduce how the characters of The O.C. spent their summer vacation. They were practicing jumping the shark. They have it down perfectly.
Suspicion,0,"This viewer simply lost the patience waiting for the show to allow Thurman, a gifted performer who too rarely gets the chance to let loose these days, to do much of anything."
Euphoria,0,"Euphoria is unrelentingly explicit this time around, as if it took one look at its former self and thought: no, not shocking enough, try this."
Weeds,0,"Pour one out to Showtime's Weeds, y'all. But not the good stuff. The show no longer deserves it."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Nine Perfect Strangers, in contrast to the strengths and limitations of [White] Lotus, tastes bland and feels tonally indistinct."
Behind Her Eyes,0,Where others excel with the dark and twisty storylines building intrigue and frightening sequences this one is only good for mustering up a sleepy yawn.
Ramy,0,"When it comes to the politics of Islam, supposedly one of the main focuses of the show, Youssef shies from delving into the growing division between secular and traditional Islam. It's here where the ideology of the show grows even more muddled."
The Afterparty,0,"The Afterparty squanders the talents of its cast with a broad, derivative and annoyingly obnoxious screenplay."
Lisey's Story,0,"Lisey's Story's failings aren't an indictment of King the screenwriter, they're a tribute to King the novelist."
Halo,0,This drama comes on strong with ambient techno-babble and bureaucratic realism. It's as thrilling as a meeting.
The Mist,0,"Okay, it's possible I'm overreacting here just a smidge. But Spike's version of The Mist is one dumb piece of work."
WandaVision,0,"Based on the first three episodes, 'Wanda Vision' does not deliver the unique entertainment one might expect. However there are indications there may be a brighter future."
Foundation,0,"We'd love to see the parts that show the story's humanity and hope, but the first episode was just too boring to draw us in."
The Baby,0,"Haphazardly careens from one idea to another, throwing in themes and plot threads that never properly fit together."
Midnight Mass,0,"They could have just gone so much further with... the mysticism, the miracles, and even the backstories of these characters."
Inventing Anna,0,This bloated true-crime drama from Shonda Rhimes alternately seeks to scold and celebrate New York con artist Anna Delvey (Julia Garner) and the relentless reporter (Anna Chlumsky) who brought her story to light.
The Shrink Next Door,0,"""Something something daddy issues"" is a perilously slender thread from which to hang an entire scripted drama, and perhaps that's why the show feels so sterile."
Elite,0,"By its new fifth season, Élite finally arrives at the point where it can no longer pull off its gimmicks."
House of Cards,0,"In the moments when Claire is allowed not just the camera but the story, ""House of Cards"" is a ride; when the past is relitigated and the specter of Frank rears up once more, it feels like that worst thing a binge-able drama can be: a trudge."
Arrested Development,0,"Unfortunately for the show, even without the controversies putting a cloud over proceedings, the simple fact of the matter is that this season just isn't that good."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,"Winning Time is guaranteed to turn the stomachs of not only Boston Celtics fans, but anyone hoping for more than an egregiously cartoonish and ham-fisted hagiography executed with all the subtlety of a no-look pass."
Mr. Corman,0,"Mr. Corman, the new AppleTV+ series from Joseph Gordon-Levitt suffers from a number of issues, not least of which is an uninteresting lead character."
Ozark,0,The final episodes were just awful. Everything that kept me from really bonding with the series about a family breaking bad was on display in those last hours.
Hellbound,0,An expendable attempt at a horror series that doesn't stand out. [Full review in Spanish]
The Right Stuff,0,The Right Stuff is inoffensively bland.
The Morning Show,0,"There are too many people on this show, and without exactly being sure what the series' point is, there's no way for the writers to know who to focus on. But I just know it shouldn't be the men."
Glee,0,"The show ends with 121 episodes, seemingly every one a little more incoherent than the last."
Star Trek,0,The less said about the reduced-budget third season the better.
The Essex Serpent,0,"A decent production budget and starry cast led by Tom Hiddleston and Claire Danes are squandered on a dreary, convoluted, portentous drama with all the appeal of a fog blanket over a giant rotting fish which someone briefly mistook for a dead dragon."
And Just Like That...,0,"If the iconic image of ""Sex and the City"" is its central quartet striding down a Manhattan sidewalk, this is a series on its back heels: defensive, reactive, terrified to offend."
House of Cards,0,"With or without Kevin Spacey, it's possible that House of Cards had simply run its course. It's just a shame that it couldn't make one final sprint toward the finish line."
Interrogation,0,The most disappointing aspect of Interrogation may be the writers' reluctance to peddle uncertainty.
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,0,"Like the Don't Bothers - like the show itself, really - she's in there swinging, but doesn't score very often."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,It's much better paced and way easier to watch. But coming back from what was a truly lack-luster first season... was going to take a complete overhaul of the series and it's hard to say if that was ever going to be possible.
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,"They try to cram so much into those episodes that even potentially interesting storylines turn into a slog, and Luke's journey goes from the understandably rage-filled chapter that we see in every hero's story to a chore."
Invasion,0,"And aside from rhyming with Foundation which premiered last month, Invasion asks a similar question: Do you have time for this?"
Good Sam,0,I'm as game as the next fan for a new House. This just isn't there yet.
Invasion,0,"A slow-moving, often tedious disaster drama, Invasion takes five episodes to get through what a blockbuster movie might take care of in half an hour."
Lisey's Story,0,"Lisey's Story is pretty to look at and fairly faithful, but far too bloated to be very engaging."
Star Trek: Enterprise,0,The most infuriating thing about Enterprise is the fact that it has always had some of the most potential of any of the Trek series and has always gone out of its way to squander every opportunity it has ever had to capitalize on that potential.
Foundation,0,"For people who know or are fans of Isaac Asimov and his work, I feel compelled to warn you that if you watch the show you will see a scene so enraging that you will tear your TV in two with your bare hands."
The First,0,"It's too much buildup for too little payoff. By the time the series is ready to launch, we're already charting a course for somewhere else."
Waco,0,"The intimate humanization of Koresh and his followers comes across as a pure defense, a vindication of the rights of fringe groups to exist with huge stockpiles of guns without attracting the eye of law enforcement."
WeCrashed,0,"Unfortunately, caring about the demise of rich people is just outside my scope of interest, and I was left with little to care about for another episode of WeCrashed."
Moon Knight,0,This hodgepodge of underdeveloped themes is augmented by run-of-the-mill action sequences that not only lack invention but also emotional thrust. Mohamed Diab’s first foray into Hollywood is a giant folly with a lot of promise and too little reward.
Tokyo Vice,0,"An exercise in lost momentum, a glimpse at a fading underworld loath to offer any perspective on it. Maybe the wildcat was just a tabby the whole time."
Invasion,0,It's nothing but a kitchen sink drama as people are running and seeing weird things happening.
Entourage,0,"""Entourage"" heads into its final eight episodes starting Sunday night and to be honest, it's time."
House of Cards,0,This is the worst season of the series despite Robin Wright's best efforts. [Full Review in Spanish]
Waco,0,"The only way the government could look any more like buffoons, barbarians, and jackasses in the series is if the ATF and FBI sequences were soundtracked with ""Yakety Sax."""
Limitless,0,"It's not heavy-handed and it doesn't dumb down its audience (although you do have to buy into the NZT brainpower stuff), it just feels like it's missing something, and I think that something may be a level of investment in the characters."
Lisey's Story,0,"The series is ultimately a cautionary example of what can go wrong with the creative process when a megabucks patron such as Apple says ""yes"" to everyone."
Inventing Anna,0,Ends up feeling like a show-length adaptation of a novelty T-shirt that reads ANNA DELVEY DID NOTHING WRONG in big block letters.
And Just Like That...,0,"If the iconic image of ""Sex and the City"" is its central quartet striding down a Manhattan sidewalk, this is a series on its back heels: defensive, reactive, terrified to offend."
What If...?,0,"[What If...? is] bite-sized chunks of comic book fun, however [the show doesn't] go further than being half-hearted fan service."
Two and a Half Men,0,"Buddy, your show's been on for 12 seasons. Don't you want to send off your characters in any type of meaningful way? Nah. Let's just use the time to get back at someone for something people have long forgotten about."
The Morning Show,0,"Too often, The Morning Show's second season is satisfied with the easiness of shock -- of announcing itself, though not communicating much of note, in a blare."
Lisey's Story,0,"It's disappointing given the top-tier cast and production team. The three brilliant female leads are mostly weeping, catatonic or angry and confused, which is relatable to those of us struggling to keep up with the narrative."
X-Men,0,The fifth season isn't worth watching.
Teen Wolf,0,"While Stiles is missed in the last batch of episodes, this fun MTV show finds a nice way to say goodbye."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"I can only speak for myself, but I don't have the patience for this anymore. At least Breaking Bad had the decency to make Walter White a tame family man before he went gonzo."
Gaslit,0,Not even Roberts’s blistering portrayal of a woman terrorised into silence is enough to save a drama that is somehow both plodding and overreaching.
Hawkeye,0,"For a series about a pair of sharpshooters, Hawkeye frustratingly misses the mark too often. Well, at least for viewers who aren't its target audience."
Inventing Anna,0,"By the end, Inventing Anna may test your resolve as you decide how much time you choose to spend in the company of an unrepentant bossy narcissist, regardless of how well she’s played."
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,"There's just too much stuff to really do justice to any of it, and that lack of focus makes it tough to latch on to anything the season is trying to do."
Stranger Things,0,The timing is terrible. The show itself gets slightly better from there.
11.22.63,0,"The resulting eight-part miniseries is an uneven affair, at times feeling as if it's meandering through history en route to its frantic closing kick."
Stranger Things,0,"In the end, it isn’t growing up that threatens the unstoppable rise of Netflix’s great homegrown hit. It’s a refusal to let go of what no longer serves it."
Behind Her Eyes,0,"It's creepy and engaging throughout the early chapters. But then? Well... then, Behind Her Eyes becomes a different kind of story altogether, and a much sillier one."
The Morning Show,0,"These cobbled together histrionic dramatics are offensive compared to the gravity of the issues of the first season. Even combined, the desperate scrambles of the second season don't have enough bite, or credibility, for the viewer to invest in."
Arrested Development,0,It's hard to argue that the show's maintained the sly political relevance that elevated it during its initial run.
Night Sky,0,"Simmons and Spacek give great performances but it’s unfortunately not enough to keep Night Sky from being a dull, boring, and forgettable show."
The Twilight Zone,0,"As with most anthology series, the results are decidedly mixed. For one thing, the show does away with its social justice bent entirely at a time in which those stories would be most welcome."
The Outsider,0,"Like the Stephen King novel it's based upon, The Outsider is an interesting, but not completely satisfying experiment... Even with Erivo and Mendelsohn as sturdy stars, ]it] hasn't quite found a way to give its plunge into the unknown the juice it needs."
Lisey's Story,0,"Learn what is a Blood Bool in this florid, Grand Guignol Gothic fairy tale, that misses an essential element of heavy material - relief."
Halo,0,The early episodes of Paramount+’s much-delayed new adaptation of the classic video game series miss their target...
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"The only thing shocking about Anatomy of a Scandal is that David E. Kelley, creator of series like Picket Fences, Ally McBeal and The Lawyer, hasn't had a hit since the first season of Big Little Lies. [Full review in Spanish]"
Dave,0,"Dave is still a biting satire set within the music industry that depicts the many pitfalls of making it to the main stage at Coachella. But especially this season, it's sometimes difficult to watch."
The Offer,0,"Repetitive for anyone who’s seen the film, and condescendingly didactic for those who haven’t."
Sex/Life,0,A Road Runner cartoon has more sophisticated characterisations.
Once Upon a Time,0,OUAT season seven suffers from the same anvil-ish dialogue it always has.
Monsters at Work,0,"Monsters At Work will reward long-time fans of this franchise with familiar characters, callbacks, and more time in the intriguing world of Monstropolis. Unfortunately, all it nails about this world is superficial, and not even appropriately rendered."
The Morning Show,0,"""The Morning Show"" keeps returning to this idea that even as the network is drowning an endless pool of scandal and drama, these people care. I don't know if that's supposed to be meaningful or ironic, but mostly it left me feeling nothing at all."
Bridgerton,0,...it’s difficult to imagine that Bridgerton will ever make quite the splash that the first season did without stars like Page who strike the perfect balance between steamy and silly...
The Stand,0,"This adaptation, which starts off succinctly, starts to strain as soon as it has to shoulder the biblical proportions. ""The Stand"" works better as a study in survivalist pluck than as a theological thunderdome."
The Nevers,0,"This is really unpleasant, and that is all I have."
Elite,0,"By its new fifth season, Élite finally arrives at the point where it can no longer pull off its gimmicks."
Ozark,0,The final episodes were just awful. Everything that kept me from really bonding with the series about a family breaking bad was on display in those last hours.
24,0,"While the format has been altered a bit... this new season is 12 episodes instead of 24 so some hours will be skipped -- everything else about the show is same-old, same-old."
Marvel's Agent Carter,0,"Get past the surface, though, and it once again looks as if the show has been relegated to the role of little more than handsome placeholder to break up SHIELD's season - all dressed up, perhaps, but as outfitted, with no real place to go."
Godless,0,"Godless, with its cinematic longshots of unfettered Western plains, a moody and effective soundtrack, and a phenomenal cast, seemed destined for greatness. But unfortunately, the town of La Belle isn't just lawless - it's also a bit aimless."
The Bletchley Circle,0,"Instead of stroking suspense, the show starts and stops in fits, never finding a thrilling stride that unites the mysteries and deepens characterizations. Let's hope that Anna isn't on a permanent vacation."
24,0,Is this a series too far?
House of Cards,0,"House of Cards...trashes itself, even if it was a sort of knowing trash to start with."
Community,0,"Ultimately, Community has written itself into a hole that I'm not sure it will be able to dig out of."
11.22.63,0,No one would figure going back in time to spare the life of JFK would be easy or quick. But does it have to drag on so long and be this tiresome to watch?
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"There is too much time to fill, too many episodes to stretch a fairly thin plot across, and too many goddamn strangers to stay interested in any one of them."
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,0,"Any attempt to reboot The Mighty Ducks shouldn't be undertaken lightly. The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers, unfortunately, tackles the franchise with all the grace and nuance of the Bash Brothers."
Game of Thrones,0,"In the final six episodes, Game of Thrones should have felt like a game of chess. Instead, it veered very close to feeling more like a game of checkers. And that's probably why so many viewers felt burned."
And Just Like That...,0,There were many inclusivity themes as a lunge for relevance that only make you remember how funny and risky the un-PC Samantha could have made it.
The Gilded Age,0,Wharton is unlikely to have approved of such a half-hearted imitation of her work.
Foundation,0,"Foundation isn't based on the books, it's inspired by them. In other words, Foundation merely serves as a - excuse me - foundation for the TV show. I just wish its foundation, the first season, had a better idea of what it wanted to be."
First Kill,0,"First Kill is a soapy supernatural star-crossed romance that doesn’t break any new ground in the genre, or elevate itself above the other mediocre series of its ilk."
What If...?,0,"The light fun of it is eaten away by the cynicism from within the project, that what purports to be about infinite possibilities is blatantly more about repurposing."
Night Sky,0,"Night Sky begins as a beautiful coming-of-old-age story, but it splinters into an overstuffed sci-fi thriller."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"Fox's delusions grow to the point where it's sometimes hard to believe what's happening, and it makes less of a statement about consumerism and the dangers of a free market than it, as I said already, does the Walter White thing in a misfired manner"
Snowflake Mountain,0,"It’s hard to determine how much of Solomon’s “personality” is genuine, but at least he provides some much-needed drama in this largely lacklustre series, which starts out so promisingly but soon peters out faster than a Gen Z doing the dishes."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,0,The series fails to recognize the key to the power of its source material: its peculiarity.
Limitless,0,"Maybe the show will improve when it kicks into the case-of-the-week format and ramps up the nonsensical effects of this mysterious pill, but I don't have high hopes."
Entourage,0,"""Entourage"" heads into its final eight episodes starting Sunday night and to be honest, it's time."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,0,"[It] feels like Stewart's attempt to evolve what he used to do for a new era. He just hasn't figured out how to do it yet, and may be too entrenched in his old approach to succeed for anyone beyond the most die-hard Daily Show With Jon Stewart fans."
Bridgerton,0,"The show tries to tack on more substantive themes, while still ignoring the ways that its world-building has come up short."
Unsolved Mysteries,0,Unsolved Mysteries is likely to stay but it has to do better to become a staple series on the streaming service.
Twin Peaks,0,"A collection of rambling and samey set pieces amateurishly glued together by a frankly adolescent conviction that weirdness in any form -- hey, let's not bother with a plot -- can pass for clever and interesting, it should never have been made."
Big Little Lies,0,"With more empathetic writing, Bonnie could have been the emotional anchor of season two."
Loot,0,"The talented cast, glossy production sheen, and pop culture savvy jokes make the ten 30-minute episodes an easy watch. Unfortunately, Loot can’t stop the glimmer from fading."
Black Mirror,0,'Black Mirror' has lost its spark as season five leans on findings of the past. [Full Review in Spanish]
The Shrink Next Door,0,"It's a deeply terrifying story of manipulation and abuse that plays like a comedy, sometimes when it doesn't mean to, but isn't all that funny when it's trying to be."
The Stand,0,"Sadly there is very seldom any notion of stakes, of consequence, or of danger in this ultimately lifeless adaptation."
His Dark Materials,0,"It's hard to imagine any teenage fan of fantasy adventure, raised on Star Wars and superhero movies, sitting through even ten minutes of this coalescing sludge."
The Wheel of Time,0,"There are worse fantasy series and films out there, to be sure, but none of them were dumb enough to give their monsters a name that rhymes with ""bollocks""."
Mr. Corman,0,Spending five-plus hours watching a very average man inch toward slightly greater self-awareness doesn't make for the most powerful TV experience.
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,You won't be missing much if you give this season a skip.
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Despite risible dialogue and a disturbing swing toward cheap theatrics, this weak but watchable legal thriller still puts a human face on the MeToo movement thanks to committed, compelling performances from Sienna Miller and Michelle Dockery."
Schmigadoon!,0,"Strong, who's one of the producers, is clearly having a ball, but Key is sold shockingly short by a lame script that starves him of funny lines and requires him to do nothing but moan."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"Jessica's 'what makes a hero?' path this season is given plenty of heavy-handed lip service but it feels more like telling than showing, especially as Luke Cage Season 2 handled similar questions much more deftly."
After Life,0,It's a season that betrays its own legacy and destroys the absolute brilliance of the first season.
Defending Jacob,0,"""Defending Jacob"" has great ingredients, but the portion size is off."
Sex/Life,0,"That ""High Impact Sex Scenes"" content warning strikes me as blatant false adverting."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"If you enjoyed season 1 you'll be perfectly happy with this addition, but it doesn't do anything interesting with a character who should feel more relevant to our current political climate."
The Wheel of Time,0,Will The Wheel of Time be a hit? Don't ask me. All I know is that I went into a kind of death spiral after watching the first episode.
The Baby,0,The best thing about HBO’s eight-part British horror comedy The Baby is that it rarely exceeds thirty minutes per episode. The worst thing about The Baby is that it’s a TV series at all.
Midnight Mass,0,"Midnight Mass only really gets going in episode three. And, when it finally sets off, it doesn't seem to know where it is heading."
The Lincoln Lawyer,0,It’s Netflix’s version of the sort of retro TNT drama that I only know exists because I left my television on after an NBA game...
Treadstone,0,It's all a clone of the same idea. [Full Review in Spanish]
Moon Knight,0,"As much as I enjoyed watching Marc and Steven argue with each other in some Gollumesque fashion, I kept getting lost when the storyline switched from one character to the other."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Only one person in this fiasco is any good: the ever-brilliant Joshua McGuire, as Chris Clarke, a Downing Street communications chief."
WandaVision,0,"As an exercise in cloning, it's all morbidly fascinating: The re-creations of the various classic shows and their styles display both a knowledge of and deep affection for old-time TV... But what was tedious then is tedious now."
Stranger Things,0,Season 4 was a 13-hour-plus behemoth that added Wes Craven to its mood board but otherwise ended with undeveloped characters and obvious but superficial allusions to contemporary crises.
Black Mirror,0,"In the best and worst exploitation tradition, ""Striking Vipers"" warns you not to treat others as a game. Then it goes ahead and does exactly that."
Fargo,0,"When one character asks a question of another and then announces with a self-regarding smirk that it was rhetorical... Fargo disappears into its own navel, where even the lint is annotated."
First Kill,0,"The one-line description -- Romeo and Juliet, only adapted here as the crucifix-crossed romance between a vampire and a vampire slayer -- seems ripe for mockery, and the execution doesn't do much to blunt it."
Midnight Mass,0,The final scene was so nauseatingly mawkish I had to hide behind the sofa screaming to be put out of my misery.
Star Trek: Picard,0,"Season 2 immediately reverses track. Star Trek: Picard gives in to audience expectation, maybe even pressure, to try and tap not just a 1990s but also 1980s nostalgia for the franchise. It largely fails at both."
The White Lotus,0,"Aside from a subplot involving cultural reparations that doesn't entirely land, it would have been nice to see a bit more exposition about what point ""The White Lotus"" is ultimately trying to make."
Pieces of Her,0,"Slick enough to keep a viewer from turning off Netflix’s autoplay feature, but too broad and detached to generate much in the way of insight or emotional connection, Pieces of Her struggles to locate a beating human heart at the center of its mystery."
Boardwalk Empire,0,"For its final season, the show seems to want to bring the focus back onto Nucky, but as usual there's no particularly compelling reason to care about what happens to him."
The Nevers,0,"The Nevers doesn't want for narrative, but it feels like Whedon throwing all the Buffy-lite ideas he had together ... and hoping some of it would gel."
Halo,0,I can safely say that the major flaw in this series is not the lack of accuracy or loyalty to the source material (though that certainly hurt it) but it is the lack of heart in the series.
Mr. Corman,0,Spending five-plus hours watching a very average man inch toward slightly greater self-awareness doesn't make for the most powerful TV experience.
The Beatles: Get Back,0,Seven hours of boredom that test the beatlemania of the most devoted beatlemaniac. [Full review in Spanish]
Joe vs Carole,0,"Kate McKinnon and John Cameron Mitchell give it their best in a series that offers too little, too late."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,It really should be known for is pulling back the curtain on the way the superhero genre can encourage the worst in us.
WandaVision,0,"The classic-comedy pastiche is skillful, affectionate and well-performed, but it's not terribly imaginative - if anything, it's a little too true to its antiquated sources. It's also not very funny."
The Haunting of Hill House,0,This Haunting is so far from the original source material that it's more of a demolition than adaptation.
Waco,0,More notable for its casting than its execution.
Sex/Life,0,"Sex/Life drowns itself in the shallow end, so to speak, by failing to even generate much heat. There are plenty of R-rated scenes-so many, actually, that they get repetitive."
The First,0,"Sluggishly paced and too familiar in its character beats, it's the sort of prestige project that surely looked good on paper but fizzles once exposed to air."
Monsters at Work,0,"Bafflingly, it's a workplace comedy. Note to Disney: children don't go to work."
Chloe,0,"Perhaps the idea was to evoke the haunting effects of memory and loss which can never be completely resolved, but it felt like a deflating end to a drama which promised much more."
WandaVision,0,"The end product is comedically wan, the double-takes broad and all the Olsen/Bettany/Hahn charm squeezed into tiny dabs of screen time"
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,My real problem with Scandal isn’t that it’s trashy or muddled in its message. I was mostly lost wondering who to care about... What’s really missing in this Anatomy lesson is its soul.
BoJack Horseman,0,[T]he decision to split up the sixth and final season makes these episodes a deeply unsatisfying experience.
Lisey's Story,0,This show is hellbent on driving me mad thanks to one of its biggest stumbling blocks: the absence of any sort of logic to this universe.
Under the Dome,0,"Under the Dome limped toward the finish, all right. But it's because the show shot itself in the foot."
Entourage,0,We shall see if the boys become men by the end of this eight-episode season. But I doubt it; they're talking movies now.
The Queen's Gambit,0,"It is a show that takes itself so seriously that, when former child actor Thomas Brodie-Sangster turns up dressed like an escapee from the Wild West, you don't know whether it's meant to be funny or not"
Ozark,0,All of this generates incident. But little has the heat of real drama.
Bel-Air,0,A confusing series that's too tied to its sitcom roots to pass for a drama to take seriously. It's unclear with its intentions and doesn't justify its existence other than to underline a new era of streaming that's starved for content.
Amazing Stories,0,When this ending comes the audience may wish they'd have watched something more exciting instead.
Marvel's The Punisher,0,"Even though he was a compelling scene-stealer in Daredevil, Frank Castle/The Punisher has never felt quite right in his own show. Season two will do little to change that impression."
And Just Like That...,0,"The result of this sequel or reboot, while not being embarrassing, is quite disappointing. [Full review in Spanish]"
13 Reasons Why,0,"Season 4 is a disaster that betrays 13 Reasons Why's characters, its only remaining asset. The show has squandered any goodwill left over by its once-charming cast."
Vigil,0,"The artificial, strained, implausible plot twists and turns come and go, giving the Sunday night BBC TV audience their fix of ersatz tension and brainwashing."
Rise,0,"Rise is not the next Friday Night Lights, or even the next great teen drama. It's more like Friday Night Lite."
The Right Stuff,0,The Right Stuff is inoffensively bland.
Outer Range,0,"Outer Range isn’t consistently satisfying as a drama series, though as an extended metaphor for television viewing circa 2022, this story of a Wyoming family throwing things in a mysterious hole on their ranch is at least unintentionally savvy."
And Just Like That...,0,"The result of this sequel or reboot, while not being embarrassing, is quite disappointing. [Full review in Spanish]"
This Way Up,0,"Lame gags come thick and fast. But, in an all-too-convenient cop-out, we're frequently reminded that cracking lame gags is a crucial aspect of the protagonists' coping techniques."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,What’s left is a show filled with so much hatred and ickiness it’s hard to believe anyone will find something to enjoy lurking inside all this muck.
The First,0,"Well shot, at times edited like an inspiring Super Bowl ad, the show falls into a curious trap of pretension. It seeks to be a ""serious"" show using astronauts, instead of being a good show about the potential of space travel."
Big Little Lies,0,"You don't hire a director like Arnold, with a distinct visual style, say that's what you want, and then edit it to be unrecognizable."
Outlander,0,When we return to Fraser’s Ridge things start out a little slow -- and not in the good “let’s just hang out with the family” kind of way.
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,"McKay has entered... an Aaron Sorkin-esque level of directorial obtrusiveness, where a filmmaker’s tics and indulgences keep calling attention to themselves, distracting from the narrative at hand rather than amplifying it."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,Nine Perfect Strangers boasts a wonderful cast that is sadly under-utilised within a series lacking both plot content and atmosphere. We wish we were seeing something on whatever wavelength Nicole Kidman's performance is on.
Severance,0,"The season finale is genuinely exciting and suspenseful, but, really, even as an advocate of slow television, we might have got there in half the time with twice the effect."
The Morning Show,0,"I liked that season one was a little campy. This season, however, summoned the ghosts of Joan Crawford, the cast of Grease 2, and Lady Gaga's Artpop era."
God's Favorite Idiot,0,"God’s Favorite Idiot is just sad. What a waste of precious time in the career of a talented performer, one whose fans will follow her anywhere, and who rewards them with so little of what she can do."
The Stranger,0,"In lieu of a single, compelling premise, its mystery is a web of disparate threads, which not only makes it plot-heavy but prevents any real character development."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"Maybe such candor is too much to ask of a show created for a platform owned by one of the world's most valuable corporations. Sadly, the alternative leaves us with a commercial for thinking about America more than a complete thought."
The Offer,0,"Strange pacing and unnecessary subplots bog down The Offer's more enjoyable moments, turning what could have been a thrilling look at movie history into an uneven television show."
Foundation,0,"We'd love to see the parts that show the story's humanity and hope, but the first episode was just too boring to draw us in."
Normal People,0,The result is hardly incompetent but never bold enough to transcend the standard literary adaptation.
Severance,0,"If the series wants to tackle the exploitation of labor, even in its own exaggerated way, it usually helps when the authoritarians' methods of oppression make sense—logically and emotionally..."
Bridgerton,0,"Theres something to be said for familiarity, but Bridgerton keeps most of the less interesting stuff from last season and jettisons the scandalous intrigue we tuned in for in the first place."
Glee,0,"While the new kids at McKinley get a few quirky gags, they feel half-hearted, as if only real remaining mission is to follow our old friends to the finish line. That's fine. But we could have done it two seasons ago and not missed much."
Joe vs Carole,0,"It's called Joe vs. Carole, but it should have been called Dumb vs Dumber."
Brave New World,0,Disastrously walked into every known pitfall of trying to turn what is essentially a philosophical discourse into gripping drama. Even mediocre drama would have been a start.
The Flight Attendant,0,"While everything was new to Cassie the first time around -- making her a sort of classic Hitchcockian Everywoman, way over her head in this world of espionage -- the mystery here proves more convoluted and difficult to track."
Girls,0,Girls overreached. There just aren't six seasons worth of interesting material for the average millennial girl to live through without bringing in sensational elements that go above and beyond an average reality.
The Book of Boba Fett,0,The Book of Boba Fett is beyond even an experiment. It should be a bellwether for future writers and producers – because it takes us all for granted.
The Mandalorian,0,"Where some will be down for the expansion of this story into the larger connected universe, plenty will morn the loss of what was the most unique piece of the on-screen Star Wars universe to date."
Suspicion,0,"It feels like Suspicion is a bunch of espionage scenes in search of a cohesive story. The story may reveal itself at some point, but right now, the whole operation feels bland and generic."
The Mist,0,Making sense of this mess is probably impossible and not worth the effort.
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,The story fails to convince that the couple shares much more than an understanding of the obstacles keeping them apart. So much time is spent on establishing the rules of this show’s game that there’s little room to play.
Devs,0,A product that delivers neither the wildly creative sense of tech's possibilities nor the ground-level excavation of his characters... Devs is a misfire for a talented creator.
Inventing Anna,0,"It’s a Sisyphean task to get us to care as much about the writing of an article as the escapades of the person being written about, and neither the series nor a surprisingly depthless Chlumsky succeeds in doing so."
The Morning Show,0,"If the first season was about the Me Too movement, the second season is about... well, I'm not sure really. The show says so much without saying anything at all."
Mare of Easttown,0,"Gone are the days when HBO would produce only outright classics targeted at discerning audiences - in the streaming age, a wider clientele must be catered to."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"The storylines are byzantine, but they are not complicated. There is also no shortage of weary, heavy-handed platitudes, like fortune cookies that exclusively quote Bob Segar songs."
The X-Files,0,"Based on five episodes made available for preview, things remain uneven -- the first episode is dragged down by more conspiracy blather, interminable voiceover and way too many apocalyptic predictions of doom."
Girls5eva,0,Despite some solid zingers... this sophomore batch of episodes feels listless.
Godless,0,I was excited for it... I think I fell asleep within the first 10 minutes of it. It was so unbelievably boring.
11.22.63,0,"Awkward and flat, never matching the promise of its premise."
Amazing Stories,0,When this ending comes the audience may wish they'd have watched something more exciting instead.
The First,0,The First needs to up its game or it's headed for the black hole of oblivion.
The Nevers,0,To paraphrase Coco Chanel: This is a TV show that should look in the mirror and take off one plot point before exiting the house.
Halo,0,"Those of us who don’t recognise every re-enacted power-up bleep and helmet-cam vision of destruction will probably find ourselves wondering, much of the time, quite what is going on."
The Capture,0,"It's gripping up to a point, but really it's just you staring at a screen while watching another person staring at a screen."
Little Voice,0,"It can be a little wearing over the seasonal long haul, but it is true in its way to our sentimental experience and why nothing succeeds in working us up, and working us over, quite like a pop song."
Pieces of Her,0,"A tedious, tiresome mess that almost put me to sleep."
Tokyo Vice,0,It all feels as dated as Miami Vice's fashion sense.
Inside Amy Schumer,0,"Even though what I've seen of season four isn't quite as funny as I'd like it to be, I hope that Schumer's benign tyranny of mainstreaming feminism isn't ending anytime soon."
Sex/Life,0,"It loses its rhythm and goes round in circles trying to make a point but it fails terribly. The writing is shallow, the acting sub-par and at most, the racy scenes are endurable."
WeCrashed,0,"However great Hathaway and Leto are, though, at portraying these insufferable people, the fact remains that we have to watch these people be insufferable..."
Chernobyl,0,Mazin name-checks most of the pertinent facts of the story. But his cheap theatrics... detract from the real tragedy of the story.
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,Not since Bohemian Rhapsody have we seen scenes so poorly edited.
Treadstone,0,"A show whose ambition to try to capture a world's worth of adventure seems, too often, like taking the easy way out from digging too deeply into story or character."
House of Cards,0,"By the time the last three episodes roll around, House of Cards' final season has abruptly buried itself in a whole host of weird, borderline anti-feminist tropes."
Legion,0,Legion is weird for weird's sake and seems content to do that right up to the end.
Battlestar Galactica,0,I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE YELLED AT A SHOW LIKE THIS. I WAS ROOTING FOR YOU. WE WERE ALL ROOTING FOR YOU! HOW DARE YOU!
The Undoing,0,The real disappointment lies in the degree to which The Undoing shows itself to be simply a cheesy thriller.
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,0,"However, season seven took this farther than it had to, losing the series' signature comedy and making it feel more like a chore to watch week to week than anything else."
Sex/Life,0,This epitomizes trash TV; it's a soapy melodrama that could be interpreted either as emotional or hilarious depending on the viewer's interpretation.
The Thing About Pam,0,"While providing superficial nods to Pam’s grievances, The Thing About Pam repeatedly recedes into a one-note character study, a regression only emphasized by Renée Zellweger’s exaggerated lead performance."
Sex/Life,0,"It loses its rhythm and goes round in circles trying to make a point but it fails terribly. The writing is shallow, the acting sub-par and at most, the racy scenes are endurable."
The Wheel of Time,0,"You are... left with the uneasy, then sinking, feeling that ""Wheel"" - as sumptuous a production as this is - has been done before and better. A couple of times, at least."
Scandal,0,"Looking back, the real Scandal was that anyone kept watching."
Limitless,0,"This is a mediocre rehash of Intelligence, which was already a humorless rip off of Chuck."
The Offer,0,"It deserves credit for elevating my overall esteem for The Godfather in one respect: At no point in all of my viewings of Coppola's epic was I ever moved to scream at random intervals, ""OH MY GOD, WHO CARES?"""
Prison Break,0,This was most definitely not the way I wanted nor expected season five to get underway. But here's hoping somehow the show is able to catch its footing because Ogygia was a complete and utter letdown.
The Offer,0,"This program insists that movies are important, and does so by pulping perhaps the most celebrated film of the second half of the twentieth century and using it as fuel for a diverting but hardly cinematic streaming series."
Ozark,0,I was annoyed and rolling my eyes. I was on the edge of my seat wondering if the show would do anything truly surprising.
How to Get Away With Murder,0,"It was melodramatic and more than a little manipulative -- descriptions that have applied to the show from the beginning, but which were more tolerable before the novelty of its serialized mystery format wore off."
The White Lotus,0,The White Lotus gets to fail upwards.
Killing Eve,0,"Instead of something small but perfectly formed, Killing Eve has become one of those programmes that seems mainly to inspire the response, “Oh are they still making that?”"
The First,0,The First needs to up its game or it's headed for the black hole of oblivion.
The Undoing,0,"What starts out as a lively drama about scandal among the one percent turns into a turgid thriller and later a courtroom drama, recalling some of the hackier tendencies of past Kelley shows."
Big Shot,0,"The lack of proper development for its teen girls is the most troubling aspect of ""Big Shot,"" all things considered, the element that feels the most performative."
Roar,0,"The problem of Roar might just be the curse of inconsistency that always follows around anthologies. But this feels like something more serious than a case of variable quality, and instead something more existential for the show itself. On"
Behind Her Eyes,0,Where others excel with the dark and twisty storylines building intrigue and frightening sequences this one is only good for mustering up a sleepy yawn.
The Queen's Gambit,0,A glamorous Anya Taylor-Joy doesn't show the true cost of addiction - but rather a rose-tinted view of womanhood and paint-by-numbers redemption.
Brave New World,0,"Despite some evocative (and provocative) visuals and appropriate dramatic tension, it fails to truly excite."
The White Lotus,0,"Without a more cohesive story giving it narrative momentum, it often becomes a series of vignettes involving awful, irredeemable people who never make the right choice - and whether that's entertaining or even stomachable really depends on your mileage."
Killing Eve,0,"Weve grown accustomed to queer characters dying on screen, especially ones in relationships. Keeping these women apart for the majority of the series, giving the characters (and fans) what they want, and then ripping it away is such a tired trope."
The Nevers,0,"The Nevers is an unimpressive monument to a storyteller whose work has meant a lot to many people, but who cannot now figure out how to rise to the moment."
The Morning Show,0,"There are too many people on this show, and without exactly being sure what the series' point is, there's no way for the writers to know who to focus on. But I just know it shouldn't be the men."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"Unless the story improves significantly, it's hard to imagine a scenario in which Mayor of Kingstown gets reelected."
The Sinner,0,The Sinner feels more like a familiar mystery series than it did at the best points in the first three years.
WeCrashed,0,Apple TV's first high-profile letdown doesn't know whether to satirise WeWork founder Adam Neumann or to idolise him.
Altered Carbon,0,"The story itself is somewhat downgraded from a provocative examination of the role mortality plays in defining our humanity to a soap opera with a whole lot of gratuitous punching, kicking, and bleeding."
The Offer,0,"Unfortunately, the resulting product is frequently too on-the-nose. If there’s any reason to watch, it’s for the performance of actor Matthew Goode as legendary Paramount executive Robert Evans."
Foundation,0,The show's starry-eyed ambitions are dulled by its execution. Its scattered focus stalls momentum by introducing and discarding characters like a wad of receipts found in your back pocket after a night on the town.
And Just Like That...,0,"Samantha Jones's perverted yet sensible energy was what kept this show together, and without her, these women are in big trouble."
Wolverine and the X-Men,0,"Blame whatever you like- the blatant Wolverine pandering, the departure from tradition- but the interest just wasn't enough to continue the story."
True Detective,0,"Ali's performance is an example of what the show can be, but the third season as a whole remains as a disappointing reminder of what was."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,None of these characters speak like human beings.
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Only one person in this fiasco is any good: the ever-brilliant Joshua McGuire, as Chris Clarke, a Downing Street communications chief."
And Just Like That...,0,"The reboot's hour-long episodes do not suit the material like the original's breezy, half-hour episodes. Here, there's more space between jokes and more space still between funny ones."
Marvel's The Punisher,0,Why are we coming back to all these people again?
Angelyne,0,I liked “Angelyne” better as it went on... without ever being wholly convinced that it was a trip I needed to take.
The Offer,0,Am offer you can refuse.
Rise,0,Imagine if Glee and Friday Night Lights had a baby and that child overdosed on Lifetime movies.
And Just Like That...,0,"Far too many 2021 cultural touchstones and new characters are awkwardly parachuted into the luscious looking Michael Patrick King executive produced revival of sorts, as if to check a box."
Game of Thrones,0,"Season 8 reduced characters to caricatures, didn't earn its character development and the shift in their arcs, baked in several plot holes, and did away with internal logic and consistency."
Doctor Who,0,"It's not that ambition is bad, but Legend of the Sea Devils is ambitious in all the wrong ways -- the unachievable ones."
Big Little Lies,0,"I admire restraint, and I can appreciate a destabilizing ending. But in season two, it felt as if Big Little Lies was missing whole pieces of narrative cohesion."
Bridgerton,0,"Bridgerton Season 2 tries hard to please everyone, but ends up feeling watered down."
Halo,0,The frustrating thing about Halo is that it tries to serve two masters -- diehard Halo fans and newbies who are used to the normal rhythms of sci-fi streaming series -- and doesn’t quite please either.
True Blood,0,"I won't go so far as to say that True Blood's limping into its final season, but it's definitely anemic."
Waco,0,"The show creates its own problems in telling this story, especially as it can't seem to handle the scope."
The Night Of,0,A show like this one is so busy saying something about the justice system and the prison-industrial complex that it rarely has a moment to consider that one of the injustices here is that a person was killed.
A Teacher,0,"That economy is one noticeable thing about ""A Teacher."" More noticeable is how seldom it feels like a cautionary tale, despite the onscreen cautions and referrals to sexual assault resources and the story's occasional explicit references."
The Thing About Pam,0,"The thing about Pam, sadly, is that despite her crimes, she’s not all that interesting."
The Book of Boba Fett,0,"The spinoff of 'The Mandalorian' had an opportunity to expand what it meant to be a 'Star Wars' story, but it's consistently stopped right at the edge of actual exploration."
The Endgame,0,It's laughable rather than intimidating.
Mare of Easttown,0,"Winslet elevates everything, but ""Mare of Easttown"" needs some serious elevating out of its dreariness and familiarity. It's certainly watchable but also predictable. Look elsewhere for light."
"Love, Victor",0,"Whether the fantasy ending is due to an early cancellation or the desire to tie everything up with a tidy bow, this final season is unsatisfying. The characters are shadows of themselves, and the interesting messiness (and queer focus) is all but gone"
Godless,0,"The show is filled with unnecessary rapes, voyeuristic violence against women, and frivolous female nudity."
Lisey's Story,0,"[Director Pablo Larraín] never entirely immerses us in horror or submerge us in grief. It's the opposite, actually. Instead of engrossed, I felt trapped."
Suspicion,0,"Suspicion still doesnt seem to know exactly what its saying, repurposing its more political source material into a series of middle-of-the-road thriller beats that are never as gripping as they aim to be."
Limitless,0,"By the time viewers spend 45 minutes learning the rules, or lack thereof, of this extraordinary universe, sticking around to see what comes next may be less appealing."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,Light on romantic chemistry and heavy on the cringe.
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,"Ultimately, the story doesn't really matter because the characters are paper thin, and efforts to make Alice more than a damsel in distress -- she's a skull-crushing, tree climber -- don't really add much depth."
Bel-Air,0,"Once upon a time, Will from west Philly was miles from home, but the show he was in knew exactly what it was and where it was going. Bel-Air finds that a difficult trick to replicate."
Shining Girls,0,"Moss is obviously a draw, but even she can only do so much with thin and confusing material."
Tokyo Vice,0,What would Japanese people do without Americans around to explain everything to them?
Earth to Ned,0,Alien puppet talk show falls short of Muppet expectations.
Killing Eve,0,I think most will be disappointed at how far from the first two seasons this series has gone and be thankful that they wont be dragging it out much longer.
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,We could've developed Bucky loads more.
The Stand,0,"As rendered in this iteration of King's epic, that mix of realism and fantasy results in a disjointed, tonally inconsistent work that manages to both over-condense aspects of the original saga and overstay its welcome."
His Dark Materials,0,"[Though] it's timely and relevant in places, His Dark Materials season 2 can't shake off the feeling everything it attempts has been done better elsewhere before."
Little Voice,0,"You can slather a hip new coat of paint on it, but Little Voice is still familiar in every which way."
Sex and the City,0,"By the time the show had ended its run on HBO, it was already like putting lipstick on a corpse; the flesh was willing, albeit a bit withered, but the spirit has long departed. Not that there ever was much soul to begin with."
The Mist,0,"Some character depth would help maintain interest for 10 episodes around a scary fog, but from the town's cops to the high school jocks, it all feels like a mediocre horror movie. That's a hard sell for 10 weeks."
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,0,"The Bad Batch is good to dip into, but it can make for a bad binge."
Killing Eve,0,Comer and Oh do their damnedest to save scripts that appear to have a surface-level engagement with the central conflicts of the series.
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"While the strong ensemble cast made for a promising set-up, the series was besmirched by an increasingly infuriating script and a trite ending that had this viewer hurling decaying vegetables at the screen."
The X-Files,0,"I honestly can't tell whether or not Mulder's dialogue is supposed to sound ridiculous (in the second episode he utters this baffling phrase: ""Scully, you looked so adorbs"")."
Inventing Anna,0,This bloated true-crime drama from Shonda Rhimes alternately seeks to scold and celebrate New York con artist Anna Delvey (Julia Garner) and the relentless reporter (Anna Chlumsky) who brought her story to light.
Glee,0,"The show ends with 121 episodes, seemingly every one a little more incoherent than the last."
The Gilded Age,0,It comes at you like an undulating wall of plastinated velvet. Watch a single minute of any of this overstyled nine-part period monstrosity about rich American families and you will end up gasping: what is this gopping Edith Wharton-style product?
Truth Be Told,0,"Unfortunately, Truth Be Told 2 does not grip at the get-go."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,The story fails to convince that the couple shares much more than an understanding of the obstacles keeping them apart. So much time is spent on establishing the rules of this show’s game that there’s little room to play.
The Staircase,0,"The problem is, in a good fictional crime story, the writers and directors feel a sense of responsibility to make you care. Here, there’s an underlying assumption that we’ll care, and that assumption leads to plodding, stultifying drama."
Halo,0,"Extremely generic sci-fi, and incredibly different from the source material in ways that are not justified.  This just doesn't cut it in the ultra competitive streaming arena."
The First,0,Packed with corny symbolism and inexplicable cutaways.
The Flight Attendant,0,"The writing is an insult to the acting caliber of all involved, especially the usually wonderful Zosia Mamet and new cast member Shohreh Aghdashloo."
Killing Eve,0,"Like a bad romance, Killing Eve is keeping its couple apart without logical or emotional justification. In the process, it’s dulled the spark provided by these two excellent actors as well as the tension sustained by their taste for danger."
Queer as Folk,0,"A ripped-from-the-headlines premise may locate the new series in the white-hot center of modernity, but Dunn and company extract little insight from that aggressive timeliness."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"If only time travel were real, they could use it to go back and do it right."
Stranger Things,0,Season 4 was a 13-hour-plus behemoth that added Wes Craven to its mood board but otherwise ended with undeveloped characters and obvious but superficial allusions to contemporary crises.
The Fall,0,"Between the spurts of sparse dialogue, dragged-out shots of dimly-lit rooms and corridors (a regrettable legacy of Scandi noir), and long periods of staring into space, there was enough padding here to insulate an attic."
A Teacher,0,t's a shame because those scenes show that the series is capable of good visual storytelling. So it just makes the whole experience worse when you realize the missed potential.
Waco,0,"The show creates its own problems in telling this story, especially as it can't seem to handle the scope."
Sons of Anarchy,0,"While it will be interesting to see the way Sons tackles loose ends, in terms of how the series explores shades of gray, it looks like it's all over but the shooting."
Black Mirror,0,"In the best and worst exploitation tradition, ""Striking Vipers"" warns you not to treat others as a game. Then it goes ahead and does exactly that."
Defending Jacob,0,Defending Jacob feels like a huge miss for Apple TV+.
Monsters at Work,0,"Bafflingly, it's a workplace comedy. Note to Disney: children don't go to work."
The Haunting of Hill House,0,This Haunting is so far from the original source material that it's more of a demolition than adaptation.
Mare of Easttown,0,"Winslet is good in this ""Broadchurch''-meets-""The Killing""-meets-""True Detective""-meets-""Top of the Lake."" Otherwise, same-old-same-old."
The Nevers,0,There is a lot going on in The Nevers. The only thing it seems to lack is a point.
13 Reasons Why,0,This show has no business being a full hour long. And it certainly has no business leaving us with an hour-and-36-minute (!) series finale.
The Mosquito Coast,0,"Remembering Peter Weir's 1986 film, a descent-into-madness tragedy set entirely on the titular coast of Honduras, could be more of a hindrance to enjoying this new take."
Doctor Who,0,Legend of the Sea Devils was quite disappointing. I appreciated the fresh scenery and all-Asian guest cast but the Sea Devils fell flat mostly due to poor directing taking all the excitement away from their fight scenes.
House of Cards,0,"The gaping cynicism of these faux Washington insiders also paints a depressing picture of the actual current climate, especially against the backdrop of the real-life controversy in the White House."
The Summer I Turned Pretty,0,"The series, which evokes YA soaps like The OC and Gossip Girl, is pleasant enough, if blandly formulaic: full of breathless kisses, swim suits, dances, and mood-supporting pop songs - plus boozing, hooking up, and cheating, bathed in fumbling innocence."
The Act,0,"Like many miniseries, the show suffers from pacing issues, hitting the same beats repeatedly to the point of frustration."
Treadstone,0,"As spy dramas go, this one is better left out in the cold."
The Endgame,0,"The Endgame is by turns boring and by other turns generic and nonsensical. Its story isn’t compelling enough to follow beyond the first episode, and we’re figuring that the interplay between its stars isn’t enough to keep people watching."
Y: The Last Man,0,"Considering just how beloved Y: The Last Man is and its long development period, it's disappointing that the show's opening episodes aren't better."
Hawkeye,0,Hawkeye feels like it will end up being a quick wiki article scan to get caught up on where everything stands instead of its own standalone story.
Brave New World,0,"The constant writhing of beautiful bodies isn't enough to keep the interest in a show with a plotline as thin as ice. Lazy writing with no engaging qualities leaves this one, one tough pill to swallow."
24,0,"24 is still fast-paced for the most part, although a little slow off the mark in its first hour. And the 47-year-old Sutherland remains trim and limber as an aging Jack of few words, most of them downers."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Congratulations to Iron Fist, which just leveled up from unwatchably bad to merely boring."
Fargo,0,"Outsize characterizations are not new for ""Fargo,"" but a balance has been lost here, with many characters standing in for the grandest sorts of evil and too few giving us what the series at its best possesses - soulfulness."
Moon Knight,0,"As much as I enjoyed watching Marc and Steven argue with each other in some Gollumesque fashion, I kept getting lost when the storyline switched from one character to the other."
Bridgerton,0,...it’s difficult to imagine that Bridgerton will ever make quite the splash that the first season did without stars like Page who strike the perfect balance between steamy and silly...
The Nevers,0,"The Nevers doesn't want for narrative, but it feels like Whedon throwing all the Buffy-lite ideas he had together ... and hoping some of it would gel."
Shadow and Bone,0,"'Shadow and Bone' is trying to show way too much in too little time, leaving its best intentions emotionally stunted and inert."
The First Lady,0,"Watching the series attempt to make sense of itself, it’s tempting to believe that it began as three separate Michelle, Betty, and Eleanor shows before The First Lady slapped them together into one."
Killing Eve,0,"Instead of something small but perfectly formed, Killing Eve has become one of those programmes that seems mainly to inspire the response, “Oh are they still making that?”"
Foundation,0,"Not much about Foundation sticks, either emotionally or narratively. There are cause-and-effect relationships between one event and another, but they're stretched across long-attenuated frames."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"Every time it feels as though the show might actually want to have a real conversation about fate, free will, or consequences, it slides away from the implication without ever fully looking it in the face."
First Kill,0,It's Buffy meets Riverdale in the worst/best way possible.
Outer Range,0,"Outer Range has expansive scenery (when it can be seen), and decent performances from Brolin, Taylor, and Poots. But neither its family drama and supernatural elements are compelling enough to make up for the show’s slow pace."
Halo,0,"Boasting no technological innovation to speak of, few performances to offer meaningful grounding and only limited action thrills, Halo is aggressively forgettable, which is at least several steps up from “bad.”"
And Just Like That...,0,"And Just Like That... isn't nearly as clever, funny or as interesting as it thinks it is."
Brave New World,0,"It spends so much time reveling in its own aesthetic that dramatic momentum becomes an afterthought. At the same time, there are real ideas contained within the nine-part series. Some of them are actually in the book."
Invasion,0,"Invasion doesn't appear to be all that interested in exploring, you know, the actual alien invasion bit of its plot - and that's a problem."
The Essex Serpent,0,This “Serpent” slithers away without leaving much of an impact.
Behind Her Eyes,0,"Ultimately, Behind Her Eyes has a lot of style to offer, but not much substance."
The Shrink Next Door,0,Mainly what held my interest in The Shrink Next Door was the myriad reasons it doesn't quite work.
All American,0,"I expected more from this show - do better, All American."
Sex/Life,0,"Sex/Life is billed as comedy drama. If it's funny, though, it's for all the wrong reasons."
The First Lady,0,"For all its glossy production values and talented leads, a few episodes in The First Lady starts to show fatigue, like three highly padded made-for-TV movies spliced together."
Rise,0,"Rise is not the next Friday Night Lights, or even the next great teen drama. It's more like Friday Night Lite."
Brave New World,0,The idea of a society where pandemics have been completely eradicated may sound ideal in this particular moment. But that's the only attractive I could find in Brave New World's utopic setting. [Full Review in Spanish]
Mayor of Kingstown,0,A disappointing bleak drama that doesn't have anything new to say.
After Life,0,"Treated with a little more care, I suppose all of this could be saying really interesting things about male failure and loneliness. It's lazy, though. No idea or message is ever pursued. Nothing is."
The Pentaverate,0,"Although its fantastic to have Mike Myers back in action, the series is underwhelming in elaborating its premise and comedy. [Full review in Spanish]"
Night Sky,0,"After that first hour, you may be holding back tears. But after seven more, your eyes have glazed over, and even these luminous stars can’t bring you back to Earth."
This Way Up,0,"Lame gags come thick and fast. But, in an all-too-convenient cop-out, we're frequently reminded that cracking lame gags is a crucial aspect of the protagonists' coping techniques."
Mad Men,0,"With each new season, I try to remind myself that the show is a slow burn. The first episode wasn't as glacial as the first episode of last season, but it still dragged a bit."
13 Reasons Why,0,"Season 4 is a disaster that betrays 13 Reasons Why's characters, its only remaining asset. The show has squandered any goodwill left over by its once-charming cast."
This Way Up,0,"Lame gags come thick and fast. But, in an all-too-convenient cop-out, we're frequently reminded that cracking lame gags is a crucial aspect of the protagonists' coping techniques."
The Big Bang Theory,0,"I'm not sure if they got the physics exactly right, but The Big Bang Theory somehow ended not with a breakup but an ""I love you."""
Godless,0,"In Godless, female empowerment resembles the adoption of a rigid construction of masculinity."
Killing Eve,0,"From the first time Jodie Comer pressed a knife to Sandra Oh’s throat, the sexy murder drama seemed to promise one thing. Frustrated fans are right to be disappointed."
Lisey's Story,0,"There are some interesting, often supernatural connections between the characters; the hard part is wanting to stick around long enough to see where they might lead."
Bridgerton,0,"Although it's hardly a failure, Bridgerton Season 2 suffers from too many extraneous storylines and not focusing enough on its leading two characters, and that's where it falls short."
The Morning Show,0,"I liked that season one was a little campy. This season, however, summoned the ghosts of Joan Crawford, the cast of Grease 2, and Lady Gaga's Artpop era."
Halo,0,The early episodes of Paramount+’s much-delayed new adaptation of the classic video game series miss their target...
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"It's a master class that deserves recognition, and both actors reach the depth required to sell the dialogue. I just wish the material was worthy of their talents."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"I had the same uneasy reaction to the podcast itself, and I bailed on Shrink early, in both incarnations. But hey, there's obviously an audience for this."
Inventing Anna,0,"While it may tell Annas story, it does so in the most basic, bare-bones manner, devoid of any real personality, fire, or even genuinely compelling characters  thanks mostly in part to the shows (sometimes painfully) lackluster scripts."
Shadow and Bone,0,"'Shadow and Bone' is trying to show way too much in too little time, leaving its best intentions emotionally stunted and inert."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Though the show repeats the same mistakes as Marvel's other Netflix series, those problems are magnified because the show lacks a compelling lead."
Entourage,0,"The show's best days are behind it, and the eighth-and-final-season curtain appears to be coming down none too soon."
The Nevers,0,"The show is being pulled in two different directions... If only we could agree to retcon the wayward sci-fi part of the story, HBO would have the best new prestige fantasy series on television. As it stands, it's likely to only get worse."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,0,"Due to its meandering nature and stretched out plot, the novel would have been better served as a well-structured film than a rambling TV series. Despite first rate performances from its stars, this is a show you’re likely to soon forget."
Brooklyn Nine-Nine,0,"There will surely be some watchable gags... but between the consistently uncertain run and a world that has seen such a substantial shift in mindset, it's safe to say that viewers are more than ready to say goodbye."
The Capture,0,"It's gripping up to a point, but really it's just you staring at a screen while watching another person staring at a screen."
Night Sky,0,"Despite strong performances by Simmons and Spacek, this series just plods along with only mildly entertaining bits of story."
True Detective,0,"The season had its moments, but it felt more like a vehicle for delivering a type of experience than a discrete story divided into eight installments. What's good about this show is almost entirely eclipsed by what doesn't work."
WandaVision,0,It's like plugging through porridge for the chocolate button at the bottom of every bowl.
Defending Jacob,0,"For a show so devoted to stringing you along for answers, ""Defending Jacob"" doesn't leave you with much once it's over."
Snowflake Mountain,0,"It’s hard to determine how much of Solomon’s “personality” is genuine, but at least he provides some much-needed drama in this largely lacklustre series, which starts out so promisingly but soon peters out faster than a Gen Z doing the dishes."
The Good Wife,0,"Yes, Alicia strides out of the hallway composing herself, but the character and the show, feel a bit in tatters, kind of a let down from the promise the show has always had and a far cry from the greatness it was able to achieve."
Arrested Development,0,"The meandering plot sucks the charm from everything. The characters feel oddly as though they don't get to exhibit or develop the traits we know them by, as they're usually too busy rattling off exposition."
Suspicion,0,"It brings to mind an important lesson: television works when it uses the storytelling tools at its disposal, rather than just hacking a story into pieces and expecting viewers to follow it."
Moon Knight,0,This hodgepodge of underdeveloped themes is augmented by run-of-the-mill action sequences that not only lack invention but also emotional thrust. Mohamed Diab’s first foray into Hollywood is a giant folly with a lot of promise and too little reward.
Lisey's Story,0,"There are some interesting, often supernatural connections between the characters; the hard part is wanting to stick around long enough to see where they might lead."
The Offer,0,"Unfortunately, the resulting product is frequently too on-the-nose. If there’s any reason to watch, it’s for the performance of actor Matthew Goode as legendary Paramount executive Robert Evans."
Twin Peaks,0,"A collection of rambling and samey set pieces amateurishly glued together by a frankly adolescent conviction that weirdness in any form -- hey, let's not bother with a plot -- can pass for clever and interesting, it should never have been made."
The Stand,0,"I can see that this concept might have seemed mind-blowing at the time, or mind-blowing at the right time in someone's cultural coming of age, but today, it is pretty old cheese, having been worked over endlessly in the interim."
The Offer,0,"There's some good and bad with this... but at a certain point, you think ""Why am I watching a miniseries about The Godfather when I could be watching The Godfather?"""
The Right Stuff,0,"The Right Stuff is not bad, or even boring, just thin and unconvincing."
Succession,0,"Season three cares only for its mic drop moments. Succession has no grasp of narrative pacing, a show that gives its audience little to invest in beyond amusing one-liners."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"Masha's a megalomaniac who can't help playing god when given the chance. But she feels increasingly generic as the series chugs along, flattening from a female Keith Raniere to a life-size cardboard cutout of him."
Moon Knight,0,"While certainly Oscar Issacs, as well as the emotional and accurate depiction of DID, manage to spice the series up a tiny bit, Moon Knight ultimately proves too adherent to the MCU's storytelling checkboxes to feel worthwhile."
House of Cards,0,"Robin Wright was one of the best things from the previous seasons of House of Cards, but season 6 simple should've never existed. The ghost of Frank Underwood became its doom. Full review in Spanish"
The Essex Serpent,0,"A decent production budget and starry cast led by Tom Hiddleston and Claire Danes are squandered on a dreary, convoluted, portentous drama with all the appeal of a fog blanket over a giant rotting fish which someone briefly mistook for a dead dragon."
Lovecraft Country,0,"The show inadvertently simplifies the realities of white supremacy with its monster allegory, while treating the Black cast less as characters in their own right and more as vehicles for a sweeping critique of American racism."
Godless,0,"Godless, with its cinematic longshots of unfettered Western plains, a moody and effective soundtrack, and a phenomenal cast, seemed destined for greatness. But unfortunately, the town of La Belle isn't just lawless - it's also a bit aimless."
House of Cards,0,It's eight-hours of filler to set up an immensely unsatisfying conclusion.
Behind Her Eyes,0,An engagingly jagged and creepy revenge thriller that degenerates into a steaming pile of paranormal malarkey.
Bridgerton,0,"The show tries to tack on more substantive themes, while still ignoring the ways that its world-building has come up short."
Gaslit,0,"Roberts simply feels miscast as Martha, to whom she bears no resemblance, physical or otherwise."
Defending Jacob,0,"For a show so devoted to stringing you along for answers, ""Defending Jacob"" doesn't leave you with much once it's over."
Community,0,"Ultimately, Community has written itself into a hole that I'm not sure it will be able to dig out of."
Bridgerton,0,"The hit series Bridgerton returns with diminished swagger. Not only has The Gilded Age taken the lead on lavish costumes and set decoration, the new season begins with considerably less heat and a tendency to the ridiculous."
Waco,0,"The intimate humanization of Koresh and his followers comes across as a pure defense, a vindication of the rights of fringe groups to exist with huge stockpiles of guns without attracting the eye of law enforcement."
The Beatles: Get Back,0,"Like the Beatles themselves, by the time the final episode drags itself to a close, viewers are likely to be ready, finally, to quit."
Mare of Easttown,0,"Winslet is good in this ""Broadchurch''-meets-""The Killing""-meets-""True Detective""-meets-""Top of the Lake."" Otherwise, same-old-same-old."
Invasion,0,Invasion is a slog - and not a particularly enjoyable one at that.
You,0,"For a thriller that was previously known for dealing largely in shock value, Joe's actions - accompanied once again by his over-indulgent inner monologue - now start to wear thin to the point of becoming predictable."
Godless,0,Godless has a great throwback Western movie buried somewhere under all the excess flab.
Twin Peaks,0,"A collection of rambling and samey set pieces amateurishly glued together by a frankly adolescent conviction that weirdness in any form -- hey, let's not bother with a plot -- can pass for clever and interesting, it should never have been made."
Community,0,it's hard to shake the feeling that Community's continued existence has taken precedence over purpose. It's an overall diminishment that isn't helped by the shrinking cast.
The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers,0,"Any attempt to reboot The Mighty Ducks shouldn't be undertaken lightly. The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers, unfortunately, tackles the franchise with all the grace and nuance of the Bash Brothers."
Joe vs Carole,0,"It’s not that the series isn’t good, though it really isn’t. It’s that with the abundant oversaturation of Tiger King having come and gone, what more can be done?"
Taboo,0,[Taboo] silently bullies you into a reverence it probably doesn't deserve.
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,0,"The Bad Batch is good to dip into, but it can make for a bad binge."
Mr. Corman,0,"The audience doesn't have to like the main character for the show to work, but at the very least, its center of gravity should be more nuanced and compelling than this one."
Suspicion,0,"The cast is appealing, but Thurman lacks energy to the point where she seems almost glazed."
How I Met Your Mother,0,"In spite of a couple of lovely moments, the ""HIMYM"" finale was a terrible miscalculation."
Line of Duty,0,It all feels very much as if Line Of Duty is running out of energy and impetus. Six seasons is one too many.
Euphoria,0,"It's the prevailing tone, at once nasty and tedious, that I loathe; watching the show, my mood hovers somewhere between boredom and dread."
The First Lady,0,"While it celebrates women who break the mold, the show itself is deeply — and dispiritingly — conventional."
Foundation,0,"Foundation has no evident limitations of any kind, yet no real visceral impact for the most part, because it's almost stultifyingly dull, especially in its middle episodes."
God's Favorite Idiot,0,"The series has a lot more high concept ambition and creativity than the husband-and-wife team’s previous collaborations like Tammy, but most of the laughs come from straightforward sitcom scenes of bickering co-workers."
The Office,0,"The Office definitively answers a few key questions about the cogs at the middling paper company Dunder Mifflin - if anyone out there is still interested in the once smart, now just silly sitcom."
Catastrophe,0,Co-creators Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney still inhabit their roles with almost frightening conviction. But I do feel that enough will be enough in a few weeks' time.
The Afterparty,0,"If you're a fan of Haddish or anyone else involved, I'd recommend you look for your yuks elsewhere. Billed as a genre-defying murder mystery, the only thing this tone-deaf pastiche-fest defies is a reason to be seen."
The Mist,0,"Okay, it's possible I'm overreacting here just a smidge. But Spike's version of The Mist is one dumb piece of work."
Lisey's Story,0,"Lisey's Story has the distinct feel of something that has been created by a bunch of men who haven't been told 'no' in quite some time. Ultimately, it is a woman who pays for their overindulgence."
Sharp Objects,0,Sharp Objects scratches the surface of being interesting but can't overcome its dull edges.
Tokyo Vice,0,It all feels as dated as Miami Vice's fashion sense.
House of Cards,0,"The story picks up on the 4th of July, but it hardly feels like a birthday party with so much repetitive plotting and counterplotting going on."
And Just Like That...,0,"I won't lie - at some level, it's nice to catch up with them. But it lacks the spark of Sex and the City. Now it's just another show."
Marvel - Jessica Jones,0,"Jessica's 'what makes a hero?' path this season is given plenty of heavy-handed lip service but it feels more like telling than showing, especially as Luke Cage Season 2 handled similar questions much more deftly."
This Is Going to Hurt,0,"I’m not someone -- this is not a newsflash -- who demands that characters be likeable, let alone that their experiences “resonate” (ugh) with my own. Unlikeability, however, is a problem here."
Loki,0,"It's interesting to think and write about-a show that's about control, order, chaos, and the unknowable notions of free will, determinism, and choice-but mildly entertaining, at best, as a whole."
Amazing Stories,0,"The upside of any anthology series is the possibility that the next installment can completely turn things around with a brand-new tale. Still, if this is the show's best foot forward, it doesn't imply much optimism."
The Crown,0,You know there are problems with Gillian Anderson's performance from the moment the camera settles on her ashen Back to the Future hair.
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"If only time travel were real, they could use it to go back and do it right."
Suspicion,0,"By the time Suspicion reaches its heavy-handed conclusion, we hardly care who done it and why they did it."
Loot,0,The greatest crime of Loot is how much it fails its leading lady.
Safe,0,There are few series on streaming or anywhere else that will cause as few ripples.
The Stand,0,"The Stand is a shockingly inept adaptation of Stephen King's most beloved properties. Nearly every creative choice is bad - from bland characters, to stilted dialogue, to glacial pacing. It's just so boring."
The Staircase,0,"Campos brings visual panache to the project, but can never quite surmount the old aphorism that truth is stranger than fiction."
Normal People,0,"We were shown banal locations and left to guess what was going on in the characters' minds as they stumbled for words or stared out of windows. That can work in a novel, with its internal monologues, but not on television."
Brave New World,0,"Both Brown Findlay and Ehrenreich seem frustratingly tamped-down here... No wonder the actors seem exhausted; their project, deep into its first season, doesn't know what kind of show it wants to be."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"A lot of bleeding-heart sentiments are expressed in a show where a white family traverse the hostile, corpse-ridden landscape from the US to Mexico like tourists in other people's suffering."
Brave New World,0,"The constant writhing of beautiful bodies isn't enough to keep the interest in a show with a plotline as thin as ice. Lazy writing with no engaging qualities leaves this one, one tough pill to swallow."
The Pentaverate,0,"Returning to the prosthetics and puns that helped make Austin Powers a classic was an inherent risk, but it might have been worth it with better writing."
The Essex Serpent,0,"If you are hoping for Crimson Peak or The Others, this isn’t it either. But, if you are a fan of Jane Eyre or deliberately paced 19th-century British dramas with solid performances, you may enjoy The Essex Serpent. Just don’t say I didn’t warn you."
Waco,0,"Waco won't be the first drama to reduce a tragedy to its simplest components, but this doesn't offer much confidence that these are the right components or the only ones."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,Is to its audience kind of like Tranquillum House is to the group of troubled men and women who decide to stay there: a place that sounds like a great investment on paper but feels confusing and not quite what you expected once you arrive.
Joe vs Carole,0,"Though it's based on the Wondery podcast that first broke the tawdry tiger tale in 2019, Joe vs. Carole simply doesn't contain enough fresh insight to justify its existence today  despite game performances by the stars."
Star Trek,0,The less said about the reduced-budget third season the better.
Inventing Anna,0,"On screen, the story is neither salacious enough nor studied enough to bring about any concrete conclusions. Instead, it falls into its own obsessive rabbit hole, and we dont feel inclined to follow."
Veep,0,The cast of Veep is so abject that it is one-dimensional. [Full review in Spanish]
Game of Thrones,0,"Season 8 doesn't feel like it was earned, with too little time dedicated to growing characters paired with a greater emphasis on rushing to major plot points, rather than proving to those of us watching how inevitable they were."
Foundation,0,"Foundation isn't based on the books, it's inspired by them. In other words, Foundation merely serves as a - excuse me - foundation for the TV show. I just wish its foundation, the first season, had a better idea of what it wanted to be."
A Teacher,0,"Mara and Robinson really are excellent, and the series has unsettling atmosphere to spare. But outside of some specific moments in its second half, A Teacher feels as superficial and generic as its title."
House of Cards,0,"House of Cards...trashes itself, even if it was a sort of knowing trash to start with."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Though the show repeats the same mistakes as Marvel's other Netflix series, those problems are magnified because the show lacks a compelling lead."
The White Lotus,0,"By the end of the six-episode miniseries, the farce is still ongoing, but the joke is thinking that things could have turned out any other way. Fates were always sealed."
Lisey's Story,0,"""Stephen King's Greatest Hits""...slow, obscure, structured to maximize the tedium and obscurity, and thus a little wearing."
Foundation,0,"Lacking wit or self-awareness, Goyer's robot future is every bit as cold as you'd expect from a space adventure that's actually all about algebra."
WandaVision,0,"The first three-ish episodes were very fun, and then it pretty quickly turned into a long Marvel movie."
Defending Jacob,0,"This limited series strains for impact. But it's unserious about the aspects of its story that are genuinely potentially interesting, and sillier than one might have any reason to expect."
Bridgerton,0,"82 million Netflix account holders can’t be wrong, can they? Well, yes. Yes, they can."
Gossip Girl,0,"With age comes wisdom? Whoever said that should have passed the memo to the Gossip Girl gang, because after six seasons, they're still as clueless as ever."
Arrested Development,0,"Arrested Development, which was once, easily, one of my favorite comedies of all time, has become a reanimated corpse that I'd like to see dead and buried."
Twin Peaks,0,"A collection of rambling and samey set pieces amateurishly glued together by a frankly adolescent conviction that weirdness in any form -- hey, let's not bother with a plot -- can pass for clever and interesting, it should never have been made."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"""Something something daddy issues"" is a perilously slender thread from which to hang an entire scripted drama, and perhaps that's why the show feels so sterile."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,The series is ultimately uncertain of what it wants to say.
Lovecraft Country,0,"Lovecraft Country is within its rights to use people as a vehicle for a story, rather than vice versa-but the story has to be considered and focused enough to be worth the trade-off."
True Blood,0,Someone should have put a stake in this show years ago.
Snowflake Mountain,0,"It’s hard to determine how much of Solomon’s “personality” is genuine, but at least he provides some much-needed drama in this largely lacklustre series, which starts out so promisingly but soon peters out faster than a Gen Z doing the dishes."
Our Flag Means Death,0,Our Flag Means Death proves to be too droll for its own good.
House of Cards,0,"The final season is not the glorious goodbye it should have been, or the one the show's best character and best actor deserved, but there's still enough of that early elegant cruelty to see it across the line."
Downton Abbey on Masterpiece,0,"For a series dedicated to supposed historical realism, Downton Abbey wraps things up with a bow of pure fantasy."
Invasion,0,"""Invasion"" always feels like it's using each far-flung story as a checklist."
The Undoing,0,"While The Undoing strings together just enough surprises to keep viewers interested episode-to-episode, its writing and direction are both muddled, making for an occasionally unpleasant viewing experience."
House of Cards,0,"Robin Wright is many things, but possessed of a light touch she is not."
Game of Thrones,0,Season eight made the regrettable mistake of giving half its time to an underwhelming villain at the expense of the characters who made the show special in the first place.
Doctor Who,0,"It's not that ambition is bad, but Legend of the Sea Devils is ambitious in all the wrong ways -- the unachievable ones."
Ozark,0,"The show enters its final seven episodes with a problem: How do you create credible foes and foils for the Byrde's in such a short amount of time?... These rivalries feel like temporary fixes, band-aids applied to a gaping head wound."
Suspicion,0,"By the time you reach the series end, the genre pleasures and the politics have gotten so tangled together and muddled that its hard to care either what happens to the characters, or what the series is trying to say."
The Wheel of Time,0,"It's hard to get lost in this world when it feels so emotionally distant, so scattered, and so packed with thin plotlines."
Y: The Last Man,0,"Considering just how beloved Y: The Last Man is and its long development period, it's disappointing that the show's opening episodes aren't better."
Squid Game,0,"The low-effort concept [and] the pastel palette freckled with blood, Squid Game is a shallow story that uses a social issue as a platform for shocking violence. Yawn."
What If...?,0,"The idea of taking such popular, well-worn characters and scrambling them throughout this massive worldbuilding experiment sounds fun, but the results so far are pretty lukewarm."
Halo,0,This drama comes on strong with ambient techno-babble and bureaucratic realism. It's as thrilling as a meeting.
Guilty Party,0,"It's clear that Guilty Party has set out to spin a narrative about a complicated woman working a complicated case. But at this point in the story, the whole thing seems on the verge of buckling under one complication too many."
Joe vs Carole,0,"Joe vs. Carole, despite some decent performances and effective directing from Justin Tipping, rarely justifies its existence."
Big Shot,0,"For a show about an ace competitor who finds joy in victory, Big Shot, stacking a canny hero against a universe of people who just don't get it, sure doesn't mind playing unfair."
True Detective,0,True Detective falls prey to a slightly milder case of misogyny than afflicted it in season one.
First Kill,0,"The one-line description -- Romeo and Juliet, only adapted here as the crucifix-crossed romance between a vampire and a vampire slayer -- seems ripe for mockery, and the execution doesn't do much to blunt it."
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,0,"The show's attempt to individualize its protagonists largely reduces them to predictable, banal archetypes."
The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,0,Its timely racially and politically charged plot lacks focus.
Stranger Things,0,"This is the very definition of “treading water TV”, despite its big-budget fanciness, Stranger Things is really no different from any generic network procedural."
Little Fires Everywhere,0,"If the series had scaled back some of its theatrics to be more subtle, I think it would've packed a much harder punch. I don't need characters screaming at each other every other scene; I need them to be saying something of interest."
Alias Grace,0,"It's mostly restrained and respectable, with modest production values and uneven performances."
The Nevers,0,"The world still feels under construction and confused about what its purpose is, something that feels indicative of the lack of a consistent architect throughout."
WeCrashed,0,I think we could all use a little Jared Leto break.
Foundation,0,"Its early episodes never quite reach that next level, or find the extra something special that made Asimov's work connect with so many for so long."
The Morning Show,0,"There are too many people on this show, and without exactly being sure what the series' point is, there's no way for the writers to know who to focus on. But I just know it shouldn't be the men."
Moon Knight,0,Oscar Isaac can't salvage middle tier MCU entry.
The Outsider,0,"It's refreshing for film and TV producers to take King's work as seriously as his readers do, but The Outsider proves that the solemn approach can go too far."
Taboo,0,"What it lacks, unfortunately, is Thrones' sweep, moments of playfulness and narrative drive - or any drive at all."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"The premise sounds so simple and fruitful. But despite all the talent involved, the result is confusing, landing in a no-man's-land between comedy, drama and thriller."
Waco,0,"The Paramount Network needs something flashy and bold to ring in its launch, and Waco isn't it. The show should have been used as an addition to something bold, not as a starting move."
13 Reasons Why,0,"Season 4 is a disaster that betrays 13 Reasons Why's characters, its only remaining asset. The show has squandered any goodwill left over by its once-charming cast."
House of Cards,0,"Plans, schemes, endgames -- who has any use for those? The crazier Washington became, the more House of Cards lost its touch."
The Big Bang Theory,0,"I'm not sure if they got the physics exactly right, but The Big Bang Theory somehow ended not with a breakup but an ""I love you."""
Euphoria,0,Season 2 is exactly what a drama seeking to spark conversation fears most: It's skippable.
Scenes From a Marriage,0,"You end up wondering whether they are true soulmates, or just trauma-bonded beyond redemption. Christ, you think, move on, but, alas, they won't."
Twin Peaks,0,"The original run is one of TV's masterpieces, and Lynch finally returning to this project -- and unshackled by network restrictions -- was great news. In retrospect, limitations might have been welcome since this suffers from extreme excess and overkill."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,0,The Man Who Fell to Earth is like the worst kind of tech bro -- it doesn’t offer anything innovative enough to actually live up to its own hype.
The Wheel of Time,0,"There are worse fantasy series and films out there, to be sure, but none of them were dumb enough to give their monsters a name that rhymes with ""bollocks""."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"The series isn't the surprising horror-esque piece it could be, and it doesn't offer a compelling statement on wellness or the people who buy into it. Nothing really happens at all here."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"Hollow characters, an uncertain tone and, most damningly, a total lack of chemistry keep The Time Traveler’s Wife from ever quite rising to the level of swoon-worthy."
WeCrashed,0,
Y: The Last Man,0,"Yes, perhaps it was a rueful joke in the original comic books that the future of the male species depends upon the utterly uninteresting, immature Yorick, but here that twist is taken very seriously. The weight placed upon the character is just ludicrous."
The First,0,"Only near the very end does ""The First"" strap in for another go, after viewers have endured far too much narrative flourish."
The Twilight Zone,0,"One of the major issues of Peele's debut season was the runtime for episodes. This season is no exception, and of the three episodes screened, only one truly earns the extra half-hour - and even then, it could easily be chiseled down."
The Mist,0,The Mist unfolds as though we'll be surprised to learn that humans are capable of cruelty.
Preacher,0,"This has always been the thing with Preacher, from the source material on. It has plenty to say about humanity & faith & life, but to hear it you have to live through the juvenilia. With Season 4, though, for the first time, that does not feel worth it."
Mr. Corman,0,"The audience doesn't have to like the main character for the show to work, but at the very least, its center of gravity should be more nuanced and compelling than this one."
Lisey's Story,0,"The back half of this miniseries is so bogged down by inconsistent pacing, drawn-out scenes, muddled plotting, and a frustratingly anticlimactic ending that all the good Lisey's Story delivers before that collapse ends up overshadowed."
24,0,"24 is still fast-paced for the most part, although a little slow off the mark in its first hour. And the 47-year-old Sutherland remains trim and limber as an aging Jack of few words, most of them downers."
The Pentaverate,0,Mike Myers' affectionate but uneven conspiracy theory comedy is let down by its lowbrow humour.
Night Sky,0,"Night Sky begins as a beautiful coming-of-old-age story, but it splinters into an overstuffed sci-fi thriller."
Twin Peaks,0,"""Twin Peaks"" still has the power to shock at times, but this is largely 217 characters (the number of actors in the new season) in search of an author."
Stranger Things,0,"In the end, it isn’t growing up that threatens the unstoppable rise of Netflix’s great homegrown hit. It’s a refusal to let go of what no longer serves it."
Mare of Easttown,0,"Winslet is good in this ""Broadchurch''-meets-""The Killing""-meets-""True Detective""-meets-""Top of the Lake."" Otherwise, same-old-same-old."
Waco,0,The boilerplate exposition feels stilted and someone needs to get Shannon a cup of coffee.
The Mist,0,The Mist unfolds as though we'll be surprised to learn that humans are capable of cruelty.
Pieces of Her,0,Pieces Of Her takes forever to come together.
Star Wars: Visions,0,"While some episodes have good elements, overall it's just too uneven. It also doesn't feel enough like Star Wars. But kudos to Lucasfilm for trying something different."
Y: The Last Man,0,"While no one would expect the dystopian concept to yield feel-good TV, watching society break down this way, at this moment, has a glutton-for-punishment quality without outlandish wrinkles like zombie gore to introduce a sense of escapism."
The Shrink Next Door,0,"The premise sounds so simple and fruitful. But despite all the talent involved, the result is confusing, landing in a no-man's-land between comedy, drama and thriller."
Foundation,0,"We'd love to see the parts that show the story's humanity and hope, but the first episode was just too boring to draw us in."
Arrested Development,0,"The more you know about what's happened with Tambor over the past 12 months and the cast's attempt to reframe it, the emptier the comedy's absurdist spectacle becomes."
The Boondocks,0,"It's a zombie show, like the Dan Harmon-less fourth season of Community. Something's off. You can't figure out exactly what, but you can feel it."
Normal People,0,An experience tantamount to being stuck on a bad date that refuses to end.
P-Valley,0,"P-Valley pivots almost exclusively toward anguish and the tension between crime and punishment, and that thematic swing... overwhelms and undermines already-established plots."
Inventing Anna,0,"Inventing Anna’s chronic inability to get to the point is reflected in its sprawling nine-episode length, each one lasting an hour or more, not least because the show keeps recycling its own flashbacks as if poking us to stay awake."
The Umbrella Academy,0,"Gets off to a great start, but falls apart halfway through. Klaus still gets a fantastic storyline, however fellow fan favorite Five is basically benched while Allison suffers character assassination. Elliot Page's transition is handled respectfully."
Game of Thrones,0,"It's such a fundamental shift of priorities that, for all of season 8's technical virtues and the sound resolution of a few story beats, it still can't help but feel like a betrayal of the show's ethos"
Peacemaker,0,"Gunn has given himself and his actors more room to play than he's ever been allotted - eight hours' worth - and hasn't figured out how to fill it with anything but the same labored joke, again and again and again."
Night Sky,0,"Flat material that wants to mix the surreal nature of sci-fi with the humble humdrum of eating at a breakfast diner, but hardly feels more urgent or clever than that."
Catastrophe,0,Co-creators Sharon Horgan and Rob Delaney still inhabit their roles with almost frightening conviction. But I do feel that enough will be enough in a few weeks' time.
Waco,0,The boilerplate exposition feels stilted and someone needs to get Shannon a cup of coffee.
The Book of Boba Fett,0,"While the series starts strong by leaning on star Temuera Morrison's strong ability and his connection to ingenious storylines, the show ultimately feels more compelled to set up the Star Wars expanded universe then telling a coherent narrative."
A Teacher,0,"That economy is one noticeable thing about ""A Teacher."" More noticeable is how seldom it feels like a cautionary tale, despite the onscreen cautions and referrals to sexual assault resources and the story's occasional explicit references."
Moon Knight,0,Moon Knight attempts to do something even more different in the MCU but it fails at every attempt.
WandaVision,0,"It feels empty and aimless, like the writers wanted an avenue to play with the TV eras, but didn't think hard enough about how to make WandaVision independent of the past."
Lisey's Story,0,"This is intense, dark and disturbing material that could have woven the thread more adeptly through the needle. Sometimes we worry about Stephen King."
The Righteous Gemstones,0,"Season two of ""The Righteous Gemstones"" is an ambitious, intermittently hysterical mess. McBride and Hill attempt to expand the show outward, often into full-on action set pieces that, while impressive, fail to find cohesion with the rest of the series."
The Good Wife,0,"Yes, Alicia strides out of the hallway composing herself, but the character and the show, feel a bit in tatters, kind of a let down from the promise the show has always had and a far cry from the greatness it was able to achieve."
And Just Like That...,0,"And Just Like That... isn't nearly as clever, funny or as interesting as it thinks it is."
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,"Some of these scenes are watchable, good even - but they kill the pace during the series' already-flabby hour-long episodes, and leave you longing for a simpler story without the padding."
Elite,0,"By its new fifth season, Élite finally arrives at the point where it can no longer pull off its gimmicks."
Turner & Hooch,0,It's fitting that McG would direct the Turner and Hooch pilot because it's about as inoffensive and bland as most of the director's output.
Stranger Things,0,"Stranger Things 4 is a sad, indulgent, at-times-predictable slog. Episodes routinely run more than an hour and many characters are mopey."
Chernobyl,0,"What makes one kind of false representation-language and accent-more acceptable than another, such as race?"
Our Flag Means Death,0,Our Flag Means Death proves to be too droll for its own good.
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"[It] spends a great deal of time drip feeding epiphanies, dwelling in personal moments and dealing in character and yet there is a disconnect. Production design, cinematography and score all come together with direction and tone yet something is missing"
The Crown,0,The show seriously falters with Diana... The Crown prides itself on verisimilitude and that starts to fall away in Season 4.
Mare of Easttown,0,"Winslet is good in this ""Broadchurch''-meets-""The Killing""-meets-""True Detective""-meets-""Top of the Lake."" Otherwise, same-old-same-old."
Tokyo Vice,0,"An exercise in lost momentum, a glimpse at a fading underworld loath to offer any perspective on it. Maybe the wildcat was just a tabby the whole time."
The Wire,0,"Season 5's mistakes-clunky plotting, false parallels, confused motivations-are violations of the realism the show promised."
Big Little Lies,0,"But by the end of season two of Big Little Lies, I not only didn't fully get what I wanted from it, I didn't feel like I got what I needed, either."
Mindhunter,0,Mindhunter stumbles by linking the intimate lives of its protagonists with those of the psychopaths they interview and stalk. [Full Review in Spanish]
The Crown,0,You know there are problems with Gillian Anderson's performance from the moment the camera settles on her ashen Back to the Future hair.
Foundation,0,"As a new sci-fi show, it would be fine. As a big-budget, flagship production for Apple it looks like a fine opportunity wasted."
Moon Knight,0,"While certainly Oscar Issacs, as well as the emotional and accurate depiction of DID, manage to spice the series up a tiny bit, Moon Knight ultimately proves too adherent to the MCU's storytelling checkboxes to feel worthwhile."
Inventing Anna,0,"Delvey’s story is riveting. The series, sadly, is not."
Star Wars: Visions,0,"If ""Star Wars: Visions"" does nothing else, it at least tells the story that, if only in part it's an important part, that the long time ago and the galaxy far away was maybe the Tokugawa era in feudal Japan."
Hawkeye,0,"Acknowledging that the character is the least-exciting Avenger can be fun in small doses, but it's not a thing to base an entire series on."
Safe,0,It's a thriller by numbers that doesn't feel clever enough for its talented cast.
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,0,"The show feels like more Star Wars: Clone Wars, and yet never reaches the heights that it's sister series did, and ultimately doesn't find it's own voice as a result."
Mindhunter,0,Mindhunter stumbles by linking the intimate lives of its protagonists with those of the psychopaths they interview and stalk. [Full Review in Spanish]
Brave New World,0,"Not only have we had a ton of sci-fi dystopias lately, but Huxley's novel is one of the most popular and enduring ever; most of the stuff you're sick of was already cribbed from it in the first place. That puts this new series in a tricky position"
The O.C.,0,"Too ironic to be a soap, but too soapy to be a parody. Take this season's dismal debut: a clunky, dark hour in which hunky Ryan brooded... He should have mourned instead the loss of the show's last, best quality-an ability to make fun of itself."
Peacemaker,0,"""Peacemaker"" exposes a bigger problem: in a minor role with an ensemble of zany characters, Cena's witty banter felt like a breath of fresh air. In a eight-hour episodic series with lackluster supporting players, Cena struggles to carry the load."
House of Cards,0,It's eight-hours of filler to set up an immensely unsatisfying conclusion.
The Mist,0,"Given the understandably low budget, it would have been smarter to play with the unknown enemy in the mist instead of making such a literal horror show."
Defending Jacob,0,"This limited series strains for impact. But it's unserious about the aspects of its story that are genuinely potentially interesting, and sillier than one might have any reason to expect."
Stranger Things,0,"""Stranger Things"" is back after a three-year hiatus, but it's hard to say it's a welcome arrival."
The First Lady,0,"For all its glossy sheen and good intentions, The First Lady has little to offer that feels truly, meaningfully “real.”"
The Act,0,"It's dull and lacking in creativity, and it's disheartening that what could have been an interesting exploration of factitious disorder imposed on another - and why we're morbidly fascinated by it - became a tawdry, unoriginal series of cheap shots."
Godless,0,"It shows, in a bad way, that the original material was designed for a short film format, and you can tell that there was no script to fill the more than seven hours that the miniseries lasts. [Full Review in Spanish]"
Joe vs Carole,0,"Tiger King’s appeal was its proximity to reality, and the voyeuristic thrill of watching a convoluted and undeniably loopy story. Joe vs Carole merely photocopies it, resulting in something neither illuminating nor emotionally cathartic."
The White Lotus,0,"Natasha Rothwell's Belinda is the most likable and human character, but her story arc is far too predictable and often gets lost in the dark hijinks..."
Star Wars: The Bad Batch,0,"The show's attempt to individualize its protagonists largely reduces them to predictable, banal archetypes."
Rick and Morty,0,Season 5 of Rick And Morty is worryingly uneven for the cartoon that breathed new life into the medium.
WandaVision,0,"It feels empty and aimless, like the writers wanted an avenue to play with the TV eras, but didn't think hard enough about how to make WandaVision independent of the past."
Inventing Anna,0,"In the end, both the main characters remain somewhat opaque, because they’re defined less by their specific goals than by the nebulous act of wanting."
Ginny & Georgia,0,"If the writers trimmed away one or two, the mother-daughter tension at its core could shine. But with so much going on, that dynamic gets lost."
The Stand,0,"This adaptation, which starts off succinctly, starts to strain as soon as it has to shoulder the biblical proportions. ""The Stand"" works better as a study in survivalist pluck than as a theological thunderdome."
After Life,0,"Treated with a little more care, I suppose all of this could be saying really interesting things about male failure and loneliness. It's lazy, though. No idea or message is ever pursued. Nothing is."
Slow Horses,0,This spy thriller hitches its wagon to an insufferable performance.
Tokyo Vice,0,It all feels as dated as Miami Vice's fashion sense.
The Twilight Zone,0,"CBS All Access' reboot of The Twilight Zone rarely beats the audience at the guessing games it poses, or when it does, the twist is so basic as to be barely worth scoffing at."
Stranger Things,0,"In the end, it isn’t growing up that threatens the unstoppable rise of Netflix’s great homegrown hit. It’s a refusal to let go of what no longer serves it."
Stranger Things,0,"Stranger Things 4 is a sad, indulgent, at-times-predictable slog. Episodes routinely run more than an hour and many characters are mopey."
Safe,0,Safe isn't without its ticking clock grittiness and compelling riddles but there's also unintended comedy involved with a story where everyone somehow unwittingly contributes to someone's dire demise.
This Is Going to Hurt,0,"I’m not someone -- this is not a newsflash -- who demands that characters be likeable, let alone that their experiences “resonate” (ugh) with my own. Unlikeability, however, is a problem here."
Lisey's Story,0,"Learn what is a Blood Bool in this florid, Grand Guignol Gothic fairy tale, that misses an essential element of heavy material - relief."
After Life,0,"Monologues about grief and recovery are painfully trite, painfully single-dimensional; it falls short of even syrupy fare like Ted Lasso."
The Problem With Jon Stewart,0,"Part of that may be because of the vitality of its guests, Jenifer Lewis and Bassem Youssef. Maybe ""the problem"" with the series is Stewart himself."
True Detective,0,"The new True Detective is faintly pretentious, manageably ridiculous, and dull."
Prison Break,0,"In a particularly generous (or perverse) move, Fox is giving us not just a dead show or a dead character, but a two-for-one sale."
The Stand,0,"Unfortunately, the sabotage of the novel's truly enthralling story-telling leaves its ideology as its strongest element."
Veep,0,The cast of Veep is so abject that it is one-dimensional. [Full review in Spanish]
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Is this an erotic thriller? A courtroom drama? An expose of social issues? At times it is all of these things, though most of the time it exists in the listless space between any clear genre -- or sense of identity."
Game of Thrones,0,"Season 8 reduced characters to caricatures, didn't earn its character development and the shift in their arcs, baked in several plot holes, and did away with internal logic and consistency."
Safe,0,Safe isn't without its ticking clock grittiness and compelling riddles but there's also unintended comedy involved with a story where everyone somehow unwittingly contributes to someone's dire demise.
Sex/Life,0,"Explicitness abounds. However, the friction that Sex/Life chases more often turns into a rub. As it turns out, both good sex and a good life can bloom when fed full-throated fantasy. But for Sex/Life, its soapy sexuality washes away its potential potency."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,Light on romantic chemistry and heavy on the cringe.
The Mist,0,"The Mist scatters a growing number of flat, unsympathetic characters across various locations and fails to manage the swath of social issues it attempts to tackle."
Invasion,0,"A slow-moving, often tedious disaster drama, Invasion takes five episodes to get through what a blockbuster movie might take care of in half an hour."
Limitless,0,"Limitless may give you an immediate high, but side effects may include listlessness, dangerous plot holes and a sinking feeling you've wasted an hour of your life."
Moon Knight,0,"The 1st episode is fantastic, but the quality quickly drops off.  Steven is fun but Isaac makes the other personality, Marc, quite boring. Moon Knight & his mythology are sloppily defined,  making it hard to get excited about this new addition to the MCU."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,"Without a compelling character at the heart of it, Mayor of Kingstown is simply a dreary march toward predictable violence."
The Nevers,0,"A mess it is, which is a shame, because of all the too-much going on, a lot of it is a lot of fun."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"I can only speak for myself, but I don't have the patience for this anymore. At least Breaking Bad had the decency to make Walter White a tame family man before he went gonzo."
You,0,"For a thriller that was previously known for dealing largely in shock value, Joe's actions - accompanied once again by his over-indulgent inner monologue - now start to wear thin to the point of becoming predictable."
Bridgerton,0,"While “Bridgerton” Season 2 arrives with all of the scandal, gossip, and sartorial excellence we’ve become accustomed to, the sophomore outing lacks the fresh appeal and engaging pace of the first season."
Shameless,0,"I understand that Shameless continues to find Frank useful, but the results are never actually interesting, nor do they ever add up to anything."
Forever,0,"The show tries to combine the more typical tropes of a marriage sitcom with the more supernatural ones it introduces with this higher concept twist, to muddled effect."
The Staircase,0,"To call The Staircase a docu-series is a gross exaggeration. It is filmed entirely from the perspective of Peterson's team, an overwrought exploration of a self-involved family."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"There is something algorithmic, machine-made about the series, as if all involved were assembled by a computer trying to simulate buzz-worthy television. Come to think of it, that might make a more interesting series."
Pieces of Her,0,Pieces Of Her takes forever to come together.
The Mosquito Coast,0,"The title, and the blueprints from other shows, seem disposable, or at least casually, even wastefully transposable. How predictably American, Allie Fox would probably think."
The Nevers,0,"Despite sexy intentions, the series is sometimes laughably prurient. Moreover, it's riddled with Whedon's signature dialogue that's entirely too self-aware with how smart it's trying to be."
Outer Range,0,"Outer Range is a lumbering, self-serious hodgepodge of sci-fi and modern Western."
Mad Men,0,"Gone are the days of ""Zou Bisou Bisou"" and Don's Hawaiian mortality freak-out. Nope. This season premiere, all we got was a cold pastrami sandwich with coleslaw smeared on the bread."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,It's much better paced and way easier to watch. But coming back from what was a truly lack-luster first season... was going to take a complete overhaul of the series and it's hard to say if that was ever going to be possible.
Community,0,"Ultimately, Community has written itself into a hole that I'm not sure it will be able to dig out of."
Normal People,0,"The beauty of the novel is that so much between its protagonists is left unsaid, but perhaps it might have been better if the BBC had left the literary version of Normal People to speak for itself."
The Wilds,0,"By starting from scratch with a whole new group of characters, The Wilds bifurcates its focus and renders everything more shallow as a result."
Sex/Life,0,"Having watched all eight episodes of the show, what I remember from it isn't how steamy the sex scenes are (not least because they aren't), but how frustrating I found Billie and all of the people around her."
And Just Like That...,0,There were many inclusivity themes as a lunge for relevance that only make you remember how funny and risky the un-PC Samantha could have made it.
Lost,0,"The series, which started with so much promise, stalled some time in its third season and will now be remembered as a monstrosity that fused kitsch to camp."
Inventing Anna,0,This bloated true-crime drama from Shonda Rhimes alternately seeks to scold and celebrate New York con artist Anna Delvey (Julia Garner) and the relentless reporter (Anna Chlumsky) who brought her story to light.
Joe vs Carole,0,"The series doesn’t know exactly what tone it wants to take. It kinda wants to be camp, but it kinda wants to be taken seriously, it kinda wants to give you just the facts ma’am, but it also kind of wants to show you different sides of these characters."
Ozark,0,I was annoyed and rolling my eyes. I was on the edge of my seat wondering if the show would do anything truly surprising.
House of Cards,0,"By the time the last three episodes roll around, House of Cards' final season has abruptly buried itself in a whole host of weird, borderline anti-feminist tropes."
The Wheel of Time,0,"The action, when it comes, is lively, if predictable, but The Wheel of Time buckles under chunks of tedious exposition."
Arrested Development,0,Fine food never tastes as good when it is reheated a few days later. Arrested Development season five feels like reheated meat that smells way past its expiration date.
The Book of Boba Fett,0,"While the series starts strong by leaning on star Temuera Morrison's strong ability and his connection to ingenious storylines, the show ultimately feels more compelled to set up the Star Wars expanded universe then telling a coherent narrative."
The Thing About Pam,0,The Thing About Pam offers an intriguing but tonally off-putting rehash of a familiar true crime story.
The Tourist,0,"What seems at the outset like a chance for Jamie Dornan to do some heavy existential lifting never quite makes good on that promise. Instead, “he Tourist”eventually settles into a conventional web of TV intrigue."
Foundation,0,"Beneath the gunplay and C.G.I., there's a much weirder show struggling to get out, about statistics and space popes, decadent clone emperors and millennia-old robots."
The Pentaverate,0,Mike Myers' affectionate but uneven conspiracy theory comedy is let down by its lowbrow humour.
Halo,0,"Boasting no technological innovation to speak of, few performances to offer meaningful grounding and only limited action thrills, Halo is aggressively forgettable, which is at least several steps up from “bad.”"
Moon Knight,0,Moon Knight barely factors into his own story.
The Outsider,0,"It's refreshing for film and TV producers to take King's work as seriously as his readers do, but The Outsider proves that the solemn approach can go too far."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"Hollow characters, an uncertain tone and, most damningly, a total lack of chemistry keep The Time Traveler’s Wife from ever quite rising to the level of swoon-worthy."
Treadstone,0,"While lots of action films require the audience to suspend disbelief at times, Treadstone requires them to saw the tops of their own heads off and remove the gooey blob inside. It's the only way you'll survive the writing."
Once Upon a Time in Wonderland,0,Why borrow a classic if you're not going to do anything with it?
Glee,0,"While the new kids at McKinley get a few quirky gags, they feel half-hearted, as if only real remaining mission is to follow our old friends to the finish line. That's fine. But we could have done it two seasons ago and not missed much."
Lisey's Story,0,"Lisey's Story is, on all fronts, too much. Too long, too over-produced, too many talents, too overwrought, too much going on."
Big Little Lies,0,Season two's biggest shortcoming is the way it prioritized Mary-Louise at the expense of Bonnie.
The Ipcress File,0,"The world has turned, and turned again. These old games feel a bit silly, a bit staid: misplaced nostalgia masquerading as thrilling sensation."
Prison Break,0,"The reality is that Prison Break in 2017 is basically a collection of ideas that Homeland passed on, if you can imagine that."
The Good Wife,0,"""End"" had moments that worked but never came together on the whole."
Moon Knight,0,"There are many interesting aspects to Moon Knight, but neither the comic books nor this TV show named for him quite know what to do with them all."
Reacher,0,"Reacher hits all of the required beats of the story but never does it with a kinda of aplomb. There’s all the elements presented here, but there doesn’t seem to be much in the way of depth and the filmmaking leaves a lot to be desired."
The First Lady,0,"There's never quite enough from any one first lady, which leaves a sense of disappointment. It's unfortunately a show that is lesser than the sum of its Emmy- and Oscar-winning parts."
Moon Knight,0,"While certainly Oscar Issacs, as well as the emotional and accurate depiction of DID, manage to spice the series up a tiny bit, Moon Knight ultimately proves too adherent to the MCU's storytelling checkboxes to feel worthwhile."
House of Cards,0,"The gaping cynicism of these faux Washington insiders also paints a depressing picture of the actual current climate, especially against the backdrop of the real-life controversy in the White House."
Entourage,0,Entourage completely lost sight of what it was.
The Nevers,0,"If The Nevers does get to continue, having someone else in charge could be the special power it really needs."
Marvel's Iron Fist,0,"Iron Fist Season 2 marks an improvement over its well-derided freshman run, but still lacks punch."
WeCrashed,0,"Its strong start meanders to [a] repetitive, inevitable end."
First Kill,0,"It's not a good show, but it does have a good message: Love is love. Netflix is releasing this during Pride Month for a reason."
Limitless,0,"By the time viewers spend 45 minutes learning the rules, or lack thereof, of this extraordinary universe, sticking around to see what comes next may be less appealing."
The Offer,0,Its goofy failures create a veritable list of guidelines of how not to tell a story when otherwise trying to get across how hard it is to make a movie in Hollywood.
True Detective,0,This season's attempt to bring back the old True Detective magic also feels a bit stale.
Y: The Last Man,0,"t takes the swashbuckling, humorous tone of the source material and trades it in for a generic end-of-the-world ominousness that makes it seem like a forgotten season of The Walking Dead."
Waco,0,"Waco won't be the first drama to reduce a tragedy to its simplest components, but this doesn't offer much confidence that these are the right components or the only ones."
The White Lotus,0,"What's lifted up are all of the critiques of sexism, racism, and classism. What's cancelled are the sources of these critiques, which are predominately POCs. And what's preserved is the hetero white male dominance of capitalism."
Defending Jacob,0,"This limited series strains for impact. But it's unserious about the aspects of its story that are genuinely potentially interesting, and sillier than one might have any reason to expect."
And Just Like That...,0,"Ah, well."
Bel-Air,0,"Bel-Air is a glossy, expensive-looking soap that, like Fox’s Our Kind of People, puts the spotlight on uber-wealthy Black families. But “fresh?” Not so much."
Naomi,0,"Moves in slow motion, feeling like a conventional high-school drama with just a pinch of superheroics provided to pull the audience along."
Bel-Air,0,"The scriptwriting has to be superb, and too often here, things fall flat -- plot lines are too predictable, character motivations are slightly questionable, and the dialogue can be a bit too expositional."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"A lot of bleeding-heart sentiments are expressed in a show where a white family traverse the hostile, corpse-ridden landscape from the US to Mexico like tourists in other people's suffering."
And Just Like That...,0,The show did not achieve what they were trying to and felt very heavy-handed in its themes.
How to Get Away With Murder,0,"It was melodramatic and more than a little manipulative -- descriptions that have applied to the show from the beginning, but which were more tolerable before the novelty of its serialized mystery format wore off."
Foundation,0,"Lacking wit or self-awareness, Goyer's robot future is every bit as cold as you'd expect from a space adventure that's actually all about algebra."
The First Lady,0,The show ultimately plays like a prestige (and repetitive) reenactment of each First Lady's Wikipedia page.
Russian Doll,0,"It is an ambitious but ultimately lacking attempt at illustrating how trauma is inherited from one generation to the next, at the expense of the protagonists’ development and season one friendship."
Game of Thrones,0,"In the final six episodes, Game of Thrones should have felt like a game of chess. Instead, it veered very close to feeling more like a game of checkers. And that's probably why so many viewers felt burned."
The Right Stuff,0,"There's not a lot of wonder or enthusiasm to this version of The Right Stuff, which mostly treats the space program as a grim endurance test."
Chucky,0,There's only one vaguely interesting formula tweak here and it's Mancini's decision to make his protagonist queer and then to handle it with a refreshingly casual sensitivity.
Pieces of Her,0,"Toni Collette is a divine being sent from Heaven with whom we are all fortunate to share time on the same planet. Even Collette, however, cannot redeem what is one of television history’s most worthless characters in Netflix’s Pieces of Her."
The Haunting of Hill House,0,"Like everything in Hill House, that terror gets muted, slowed down and picked over so much that it ends up banal and lifeless."
Star Trek,0,The less said about the reduced-budget third season the better.
Lisey's Story,0,"""Stephen King's Greatest Hits""...slow, obscure, structured to maximize the tedium and obscurity, and thus a little wearing."
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,0,"By the time of its seventh and final season, there was a feeling that many of the cast just wanted it all to be over - something unfortunately reflected in the performances."
And Just Like That...,0,"Modernizing the original's much-beloved and extremely glamorous world has for some reason meant making it drearier, more awkward, and overall less joyful to inhabit."
The First,0,"Only near the very end does ""The First"" strap in for another go, after viewers have endured far too much narrative flourish."
The Mosquito Coast,0,The tone-deaf tourism of The Mosquito Coast makes for an adventure that's increasingly difficult to go along with.
Taboo,0,"Taboo is not so much a show as it is an ordeal, a slog through a miasma of squalid period clichés that's possibly even less inviting than last season's FX vanity production, The Bastard Executioner."
The Umbrella Academy,0,"This is the most apocalyptic-y apocalypse ever, but it carries no real weight. Then when you find out what has to be done to save the universe, it just feels very underwhelming. Samurais, really?"
Entourage,0,"The show's best days are behind it, and the eighth-and-final-season curtain appears to be coming down none too soon."
The Stand,0,"While it may sound as if this would be particularly frightening to watch right now, the truth is that this much-awaited series is a bit of an anti-climax."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"This is serious subject matter, but it’s hard not to laugh at some bizarrely surreal flourishes, the howlingly bad dialogue and the preposterously prim accents."
Prison Break,0,"Once the thrill of becoming reacquainted wears off, you're left with a somewhat muddled, not at all credible yarn."
What If...?,0,"Perhaps Marvel's What If...? will be more accessible to non-discerning younger viewers, but for adults, there is not much here to recommend."
Mayor of Kingstown,0,Mostly Renner just acts tired and frustrated. The feeling is contagious.
Turner & Hooch,0,"Even if Hooch sits at attention like a good dog, after a few episodes of Turner & Hooch, it's hard to share that patience or loyalty."
The Nevers,0,"There's a lot of that carelessness throughout The Nevers. Or maybe it's just that there's simply a lot happening in The Nevers, and it's hard to keep track of it all."
The Affair,0,Cringeworthy: that is the only descriptor for the events that transpire throughout this episode.
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"There is too much time to fill, too many episodes to stretch a fairly thin plot across, and too many goddamn strangers to stay interested in any one of them."
WandaVision,0,"It feels empty and aimless, like the writers wanted an avenue to play with the TV eras, but didn't think hard enough about how to make WandaVision independent of the past."
The Last Days of Ptolemy Grey,0,The series starts strong but its main character only grows thinner as the story progresses.
The Pentaverate,0,Little more than a cheap excuse for Myers to put on some prosthetics and do silly voices
Halo,0,The frustrating thing about Halo is that it tries to serve two masters -- diehard Halo fans and newbies who are used to the normal rhythms of sci-fi streaming series -- and doesn’t quite please either.
Looking for Alaska,0,"This is all pretty stiff, predictable stuff, built around the operatic pangs of teen romance."
WandaVision,0,"I'm like, where you going with this?"
The Mosquito Coast,0,"""The Mosquito Coast"" works best when you just follow along with the running and don't think too hard about the rest, but the running itself becomes tedious after awhile. Not everything makes perfect sense, or seems remotely plausible."
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"I think the most off-putting thing about The Time Traveler’s Wife, right from the jump, is how strangely chintzy and thin it looks."
The Wheel of Time,0,"Shows like The Wheel of Time feel reverse-engineered from an ideal outcome. And, unlike in fantasies, prophecies in the real world aren't guaranteed to come true..."
The Undoing,0,"While The Undoing strings together just enough surprises to keep viewers interested episode-to-episode, its writing and direction are both muddled, making for an occasionally unpleasant viewing experience."
WandaVision,0,"Once WandaVision starts recycling the same content in each episode, it becomes difficult to ignore that the show's primary interest is playing with form rather than propelling its story forward."
The Wheel of Time,0,"While there is enough violence and faux-mysticism to keep genre fans happy, convincing human interactions are harder to find."
The Act,0,Watch Mommy Dead and Dearest as well as the various interviews with Gypsy Rose Blanchard instead; they'll be a lot more fascinating to watch than The Act.
The Nevers,0,"The anchor on The Nevers is that it never seems to take off, at least from the episodes I've seen... For now, The Nevers never will do."
The Offer,0,The depictions of real-life actors border on mimicry... The various Mafia personages appear to have watched The Godfather once too often.
The Undoing,0,"""The Undoing"" is somewhat undone by its dawdling pace."
Altered Carbon,0,"The story itself is somewhat downgraded from a provocative examination of the role mortality plays in defining our humanity to a soap opera with a whole lot of gratuitous punching, kicking, and bleeding."
What If...?,0,"A galaxy-level cast, for a TikTok-level Disney+ series. [Marvel's] first animated series [...] allows it to operate on a different canvas [but] the first three episodes don't push the envelope. What If...? feels like a footnote in the MCU encyclopaedia."
The Thing About Pam,0,The Thing About Pam offers an intriguing but tonally off-putting rehash of a familiar true crime story.
Shining Girls,0,Too many threads are left dangling or unexplained. You never get that satisfying feeling of everything clicking into place by the end.
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"The dull courtroom sequences occasionally slip into stagey reconstructions of what happened between defendant and accused. At no point does Kelley’s series pause to consider what it is it’s trying to say about, um, well, anything."
Amazing Stories,0,"Without spoiling too much,""The Cellar"" feels overstuffed with narrative jumps and character choices that are often puzzling."
Midnight Mass,0,"Midnight Mass only really gets going in episode three. And, when it finally sets off, it doesn't seem to know where it is heading."
The Crown,0,"The Crown has firmly placed itself as yet another vehicle of Britain's colonial amnesia, blissfully neglectful of the collective traumas of postcolonial nations."
The Nevers,0,"A generous take on The Nevers is that it's a fin de siècle X-Men, or maybe a Victorian Watchmen. A less generous take is that it's a more expensive version of Fox's The Gifted, one made without any clear understanding of hour-long cable narrative rhythm."
The First,0,"[Tom] acts like a complex hero in this post-""Sopranos"" era, but the aimless writing and the arty editing leave him flat."
The Wheel of Time,0,"The Wheel Of Time is definitely a talky mess of a show, at least to start. It throws a lot of characters at us, but somehow all the time taken to establish them doesn't give us any more idea about them than when the episode started."
Inventing Anna,0,This bloated true-crime drama from Shonda Rhimes alternately seeks to scold and celebrate New York con artist Anna Delvey (Julia Garner) and the relentless reporter (Anna Chlumsky) who brought her story to light.
The Me You Can't See,0,"There is no doubt that every contributor's motives here were pure. But standing outside and looking at the programme as an artefact and an influence on debate, one might ask whether sharing stories always means giving back"
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,Light on romantic chemistry and heavy on the cringe.
Servant,0,"Those who've been just as mystified, expecting a third season to answer the many questions it's raised, or at least a deeper dive following the supernatural events of the Season One cliffhanger, will be terribly disappointed."
The Stand,0,"This adaptation, which starts off succinctly, starts to strain as soon as it has to shoulder the biblical proportions. ""The Stand"" works better as a study in survivalist pluck than as a theological thunderdome."
Taboo,0,"This is the trouble with the show overall: It's just not clear, even after three episodes, what the fascinating James Keziah Delaney wants."
MacGruber,0,"It's hard to get excited for a sequel to a film that wasn't very good to begin with, especially when the sequel is three times as long."
Anatomy of a Scandal,0,"Despite risible dialogue and a disturbing swing toward cheap theatrics, this weak but watchable legal thriller still puts a human face on the MeToo movement thanks to committed, compelling performances from Sienna Miller and Michelle Dockery."
Nine Perfect Strangers,0,"The cast of Nine Perfect Strangers is too good for the limited series to ever be unwatchable. But after seeing six of eight hour-long episodes, I'm pretty sure the biggest mystery has nothing to do with any of the damaged characters."
The Right Stuff,0,"There's not a lot of wonder or enthusiasm to this version of The Right Stuff, which mostly treats the space program as a grim endurance test."
Big Little Lies,0,The flattening of previously full characters may be the biggest loss of this season.
X-Men,0,Frankly - and it pains me to say this - it would be better if the final season of X-Men: The Animated Series didn't exist at all.
The Shrink Next Door,0,Mainly what held my interest in The Shrink Next Door was the myriad reasons it doesn't quite work.
Godless,0,"Godless foregrounds by-the-book gunslingers and manhunts that take a promising concept and translate it into familiar, if handsomely presented, clich."
Lost,0,The series squandered its final season in a misguided effort to transform its trademark narrative ingenuity into a grand metaphysical statement.
Ramy,0,"Even one great supporting performance, itself overcoming a relatively one-note character, doesn't make the season any less disappointing."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"The most prescient thing this version of The Mosquito Coast has to say about capitalism is how quickly it morphs into a knockoff of Breaking Bad and Ozark, repackaging a primetime TV template to bring an old story to a new audience."
Lisey's Story,0,"Acknowledging its prettiness and production values, and some excellent performances, I found it better than unbearable but something less than beautiful."
Weeds,0,"What was once a contained and quirky -- though sometimes dark -- comedy about a mess of a woman, has become a global disaster."
Brave New World,0,"The constant writhing of beautiful bodies isn't enough to keep the interest in a show with a plotline as thin as ice. Lazy writing with no engaging qualities leaves this one, one tough pill to swallow."
Winning Time: The Rise of the Lakers Dynasty,0,"Winning Time is guaranteed to turn the stomachs of not only Boston Celtics fans, but anyone hoping for more than an egregiously cartoonish and ham-fisted hagiography executed with all the subtlety of a no-look pass."
Community,0,"The last season of Community was really, truly awful. I mean, it crashed and burned. And for a show as self-aware as this one, there's no way it didn't know it."
The Flight Attendant,0,"I never understood the appeal of The Flight Attendant, and I still don't."
Lost,0,The richest fantasy series I've seen. But its wrap-up sixth season is a drag: This spidery metaphysical puzzle seems to be dwindling down to a hokey primordial myth of good and evil.
Amazing Stories,0,"With only 52 minutes of running time, The Cellar feels like a TV movie condensed to the length of a TV episode. Its characters are painted in wide brush strokes."
Invincible,0,"Invincible has the potential to become a better show, but only if the makers move beyond this adolescent mockery of a superhero series and into a zone of mature storytelling. The ingredients are already there. The mixing needs to be better."
The Offer,0,"There's some good and bad with this... but at a certain point, you think ""Why am I watching a miniseries about The Godfather when I could be watching The Godfather?"""
Ginny & Georgia,0,"Unfortunately, the show's ambitions for bigger stakes mean trading in some of the character-based intimacy that is the series' calling card. Go big or go home, they say - but Ginny & Georgia makes a strong case for staying cozy."
Bridgerton,0,...it’s difficult to imagine that Bridgerton will ever make quite the splash that the first season did without stars like Page who strike the perfect balance between steamy and silly...
Bridgerton,0,Bridgerton season 2 is a lackluster season that hopes to recapture the heights of its first but mostly falls short.
Coyote,0,Assembled from spare parts left over from previous television trends and decaying prejudices.
We Own This City,0,"The shows talented cast and shocking plot compel, but its dry factual narrative and blind-spot-heavy examination of policing make for an ultimately unsatisfying viewing experience."
Monsters at Work,0,"Monsters At Work will reward long-time fans of this franchise with familiar characters, callbacks, and more time in the intriguing world of Monstropolis. Unfortunately, all it nails about this world is superficial, and not even appropriately rendered."
Invasion,0,Invasion is an admirable attempt at subverting the expectations that come with a big budget sci-fi show about alien invaders; the only problem is that it's not very interesting or exciting.
Dr. Brain,0,"For a show with a wild central premise and a goofily brazen title, nothing here rises to the level of wildness that the show is teasing, nor is there the sort of grounding that could work as an alternative."
Big Little Lies,0,"HBO, determined to win some more Emmys, and replicate the lighting-in-a-bottle brilliance that was season one, made a season that fails to justify its existence."
Tokyo Vice,0,"An exercise in lost momentum, a glimpse at a fading underworld loath to offer any perspective on it. Maybe the wildcat was just a tabby the whole time."
And Just Like That...,0,Ask not whether fans needed this reboot but why Parker and King wanted to go to all this trouble in the first place.
Behind Her Eyes,0,It opts for a bizarre shock that's baffling at best and deeply tone-deaf at its worst.
The Thing About Pam,0,"A watchable if often underwhelming true crime docudrama that wants to both be weird and play it safe, ending up in a strange middle ground between the two."
The End of the F...ing World,0,Totally disappointing. [Full review in Spanish]
Halo,0,"Boasting no technological innovation to speak of, few performances to offer meaningful grounding and only limited action thrills, Halo is aggressively forgettable, which is at least several steps up from “bad.”"
Brave New World,0,"Huxley's novel was revolutionary when it was published nearly 90 years ago, but the show has turned it into just another piece of consumer content."
Arrested Development,0,"Unfortunately for the show, even without the controversies putting a cloud over proceedings, the simple fact of the matter is that this season just isn't that good."
Jersey Shore,0,"Just because the Jersey Shore era has come to a close, let's not pump it up with either instant nostalgia or importance."
Big Shot,0,"It's a mess, and it doesn't even have the good grace to be a fun one."
Behind Her Eyes,0,Where others excel with the dark and twisty storylines building intrigue and frightening sequences this one is only good for mustering up a sleepy yawn.
Inventing Anna,0,"If Inventing Anna possesses any relevance at all, its due to the quality of its cast."
Bridgerton,0,"The real scandal of Bridgerton: Try as it might, it’s no substitute for Jane Austen."
Guilty Party,0,"While a 30-minute dramatic series is often welcome, ""Guilty Party"" might have been better suited to a one-hour format that would allow Addelman and her team to flesh out the characters and their motivations as well as fine tune the tone."
The Thing About Pam,0,"The thing about Pam, sadly, is that despite her crimes, she’s not all that interesting."
The Endgame,0,"Morena Baccarin and Ryan Michelle Bathe, longtime supporting players getting starring roles in a large-scale series for the first time, do not feel irreplaceable, and the show's clunky, obvious writing doesn't give them much to work with."
Lisey's Story,0,"The series is beautifully shot, features stellar performances and production values, and oozes with haunting atmosphere. That said, its story rarely achieves the high bar set by these other elements."
Loki,0,"The idea of Loki bouncing around history and stirring up trouble is more than enough ammo for a series, but Loki makes the bizarre choice of bogging itself down under layers and layers of bureaucracy."
The White Lotus,0,"What's lifted up are all of the critiques of sexism, racism, and classism. What's cancelled are the sources of these critiques, which are predominately POCs. And what's preserved is the hetero white male dominance of capitalism."
Castle Rock,0,"There are so many threads being woven together, and try as they might, there's just not enough knots being tied to make it all work. In the end, everyone suffers, and we're left with cheeky references, hollow drama, and zero stakes."
The Fall,0,"Its hallmark traits of knife-edge tension, sexual discussion and psychologically-charged scenes have been posted missing, and replaced with an hour of medical procedures and jargon that would bore the most ardent of E.R. fans."
And Just Like That...,0,"And Just Like That... A New Chapter of Sex and the City is a clumsy, cringe-inducing revival that fails to recapture the magic of the original."
The Crown,0,"The Crown has firmly placed itself as yet another vehicle of Britain's colonial amnesia, blissfully neglectful of the collective traumas of postcolonial nations."
Loot,0,"The talented cast, glossy production sheen, and pop culture savvy jokes make the ten 30-minute episodes an easy watch. Unfortunately, Loot can’t stop the glimmer from fading."
The Mosquito Coast,0,"""The Mosquito Coast"" works best when you just follow along with the running and don't think too hard about the rest, but the running itself becomes tedious after awhile. Not everything makes perfect sense, or seems remotely plausible."
Bridgerton,0,"Bridgerton Season 2 tries hard to please everyone, but ends up feeling watered down."
The First Lady,0,"Watching the series attempt to make sense of itself, it’s tempting to believe that it began as three separate Michelle, Betty, and Eleanor shows before The First Lady slapped them together into one."
Marvel's Luke Cage,0,"That's a close metaphor for season 2, in that a prominent adaptation of a beloved comic property invites more scrutiny, and it's a shame it doesn't deliver."
The Undoing,0,"A bad man getting away with a bad thing? Lawyers obfuscating the wheels of justice? It's all too familiar. And perhaps this is just 2020 talking, but it's a little exhausting, too."
The Twilight Zone,0,"CBS All Access' reboot of The Twilight Zone rarely beats the audience at the guessing games it poses, or when it does, the twist is so basic as to be barely worth scoffing at."
The Man Who Fell to Earth,0,The series fails to recognize the key to the power of its source material: its peculiarity.
The Time Traveler's Wife,0,"Every time it feels as though the show might actually want to have a real conversation about fate, free will, or consequences, it slides away from the implication without ever fully looking it in the face."
Foundation,0,"Beneath the gunplay and C.G.I., there's a much weirder show struggling to get out, about statistics and space popes, decadent clone emperors and millennia-old robots."
WandaVision,0,"I'm like, where you going with this?"
Big Little Lies,0,"HBO, determined to win some more Emmys, and replicate the lighting-in-a-bottle brilliance that was season one, made a season that fails to justify its existence."
Moon Knight,0,"Moon Knight is a snooze fest. Most of it is about MacGuffins ... and as the hero and villain chase, find, and procure them, the new Marvel series becomes too plot driven. (This also results in obvious and unnecessary exposition.)"
Lisey's Story,0,"Despite the involvement of starry names in front of and behind the camera, intriguing fantasy elements and fascinating themes, the show never achieves the resonance it seems to be reaching for"
Marvel's The Punisher,0,The Punisher season two is relentlessly blood and guts and that unfortunately is just punishing on to itself after a while.
Big Little Lies,0,"As good as the cast was, they couldn't quite lift Big Little Lies above the ordinary."
